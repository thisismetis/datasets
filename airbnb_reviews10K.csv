We loved that there is a driveway, easy keyless entry, safe and lovely neighborhood and very close to good eats, shopping and the highway to get around Denver. The beds are super comfortable and the closets are stocked with essentials and more, the fridge and cupboards are also filled with staples and the laundry room was also loaded with all you need to enjoy your stay. The backyard and patio is also great to enjoy too!! We felt at home there and would recommend. We would definitely stay again when in Denver!!"

The light rail is a block away and the neighborhood has yummy restaurants! Jacob was a great host and very accommodating! I would definitely stay there again!"

21080559,309140984,2018-08-17,16902877,Rachael,"Easy entry, easy check out. The noise from upstairs carries a bit into the basement, but otherwise nice place to stay."
37183949,563039377,2019-11-11,121520718,Sjmoya,"Bobby & Julie’s place is an amazing place to stay! When we checked in, we were amazed at the cleanliness of the entire space! It is very spacious and can easily accommodate 4 people as listed. Check in instructions were provided and responses were always fast from the hosts. We requested a later check out and they were more than willing to help with that. Before checking out, we had to try the burritos that were in the freezer for breakfast and they were delicious and a nice little touch. Would definitely stay here again!"

26453227,324273399,2018-09-16,144091786,Patrice,Great back yard.
19988833,213526285,2017-11-21,120430641,Karen,"Clean, convenient and comfortable!"
21297522,302456461,2018-08-05,35557069,Mimi,The Home was just what we were looking for with a big group and  reasonable priced. The house is nice and was exactly what we expected. We had a great stay!  
8954951,232336809,2018-02-04,50338319,Vanessa,So glad we chose this place! Plenty of room for our group of 6. It was within walking distance of bars and restaurants and short drives to other places in Denver. Ena answered any of our questions so quickly. Definitely would stay here again!
14932614,143190426,2017-04-10,9194651,Kelli,"Everything was great! Joseph was a great host; very nice, stayed in communication, and even had some food items there for us which made things just that more comfortable. It's a small house, but everything you need is there and the bed was super comfy. "
27432643,432096914,2019-04-02,6411227,Amanda,Excellent location and very cute place. Perfect for a trip to Denver. The bathroom is on the small side but overall the place is spacious and very nice. Would definitely stay there again.
7843605,438010015,2019-04-15,249965022,Christopher,"Place was great, clean and accommodating only problem was water draining can be loud"
21816001,295045044,2018-07-22,161526297,Jonathan,Great location. it's a good place for two people that are going to be out and about and just need a place to sleep. 
17498473,202303280,2017-10-10,54374165,Henry,"This is the perfect space for a solo traveler or couple. My girlfriend and I stayed the first week of October. Rafer and Channing were very prompt in replying to all of our messages and everything was ready for a self check-in when we arrived. Being that we flew into Denver well after midnight on a weeknight it was awesome that self check in is an option. There's a lot of privacy to the space and you can come and go freely as the private entrance is literally at the front of the house and let's out directly to the sidewalk. Overall this is a great location and transportation options are wide open. A Lyft ride to anywhere you'd like to go (downtown, stadiums, suburbs, museums etc) is ~$15-20 or less and the rail station is less than 2 blocks away and across no major streets. The location feels like it's in the heart of the city without making you pay a premium for it."
4051568,54138068,2015-11-16,10024384,Isabel,"I wish there was a 4.5 star option as that's what I'd give our experience at staying at Alyssa's place.

We were 3 people staying at her place and it was very comfortable. The bathrooms were all very big in size and really liked what they did with the space, especially the main floor where the living room, dining room and kitchen were - incredibly spacious.

The location was really good too. An uber to downtown was less than $10 one-way and there's an area with lots of restaurants. There is a Safeway close by as well.

The 1/2 star is primarily because it took a few trials to get in the first night and it was approximately 11pm. But luckily Alyssa was very flexible and available and tended to our needs right away. I was impressed at how quickly she responded to our text messages. The TV was also a bit difficult to figure out with the Apple TV vs Cable vs DVD player so in the end we hooked up our laptop to the TV and streamed it that way. 

So in all in all, the stay was more than satisfactory. The tech challenges we overcame easily they were not hindrances at all. 

We would stay at this place again and highly recommend it."
15344781,277593238,2018-06-16,23752448,Tohmas,Was exactly as stated. Very nice person

6333040,50901549,2015-10-15,39064702,Sloane,Micks Home could not have been more welcoming and comforting. He has thought of everything to make this pretty little studio comfortable for his guests. The entire property was gorgeous. I will hopefully be staying here again here soon! 
8721578,58936054,2016-01-05,50386928,Nicholas,"Stephanies place was great value for money, intimate and homely.she made an effort to make my stay enjoyable and was always up for good conversation.accommodation was clean and as described, located on the suburbs but only ten minutes drive to downtown, very close to local restaurants.half hour or so to boulder which is great."
14728998,192055611,2017-09-09,50329143,Nick,"This place was perfect and super close to shops, downtown, and everything else.  It had everything we needed and more. The robs were an awesome touch and especially with the jacuzzi. Would definitely book again! Steven and his wife were great, especially for accommodating us for an earlier check-in than we thought. They were awesome!"
31089043,515313813,2019-08-22,268195899,Cynthia,The apartment was very comfortable and in a convenient area of Denver. I appreciate the quick responses to questions via email!

16065774,165383611,2017-07-01,16307170,Paul,Really nice place! Thanks so much for being awesome hosts!
38522086,562250533,2019-11-10,168227570,Jessica,Heather is amazing. She is quick to respond if you have a question or an issue. We were a little worried about not being able to control the temperature but we asked her to adjust it and it was perfect the rest of the week. This is a great place if you’re staying longer than a couple of days. Perfect if you want to cook most of your meals. Amazing value and very centralized to everything in Denver. 100% will use again if we make it back to Colorado!
8474753,131748900,2017-02-13,101289971,Kennedy,"The set up was great and everything was very nice and clean. The only thing to be aware of is that you cannot roll your luggage from the front of the house to the back, so if you have large bags like me, be prepared to carry them. "
13081152,536871220,2019-09-27,229930737,Stephen,"Stay was as expected, bathroom could use some work though. Overall a great stay."
20695085,531521175,2019-09-17,126170316,Stephanie,"Megan is so incredibly gracious and inviting! If you love to work out, check out her Barre class on site! The apartment was sparkling clean, has everything that you need and a super comfy bed, which is so important when we travel. We will most definitely stay with Megan our next trip to Denver! It’s also right across the street from the pool, play ground and park area. Such a beautiful place!"
21037776,302564277,2018-08-05,98832961,Tara,Great place to stay in Denver...
90307,3036596,2012-12-06,748115,Christine,"Doreen and Shane were lovely hosts, accommodating, interesting, friendly. Their home was charming and conveniently located near where I was working. My room had an enormous, comfy bed, views of the pretty back and side yard. The bathroom was immaculate with a great shower and a big cushy towel.  They have a very sweet dog and a cat. Both were home while I was there and they did everything possible to make my stay comfortable. Doreen even loaned me her bike for the day so I could get to some appointments. They offered coffee and breakfast, fast wifi and as I mentioned, stimulating conversation. I highly recommend them as airbnb hosts. "
21803491,246639890,2018-03-25,118569849,Senica,"Great location, outstanding accommodation and Leon  was an amazing host. Everything was perfect. Thank you."

7584529,470970077,2019-06-16,163580961,Erika,"Highly recommend this place for anyone traveling solo or with a partner. Super nice, private space about a 10-15 minute ride from all the action. Amy was a great host and provided a lot of little extras, including local tips and recommendations, that made the stay extra comfortable and fun!"
678602,463024668,2019-06-02,79086573,David,"This is a wonderful place. Leigh is helpful, and the space is large, clean, with a wonderful kitchen. We also enjoyed the back patio. The only drawback was the noise from the street and from partying neighbors."
21782254,273027066,2018-06-04,58542294,Jeri,"This apartment was amazing and clean! It was beautiful, well-maintained, and very private. My husband and I couldn’t have found a better place to stay. We would recommend Paula’s place to anyone that comes to Denver! "

8411050,294909107,2018-07-22,122939614,Maikalina,"This is the second time my fiance and I have stayed with Dave, which speaks to his accommodations and interactions.

Dave is quick/clear with communication and probably one of the most chill hosts you'll come across. 

We never have to pack toiletries, as he provides all of them in each room. We've also heard that many AirBnBs in the area don't have AC, but each of Dave's rooms do.

The house itself is in a great location, with just a $5 Lyft or Uber to downtown Denver.

Overall, great stay for those who will be in-and-out throughout the trip."
9135545,159816876,2017-06-11,80982884,Aquiles,Perfect!
14724270,290555588,2018-07-14,35520496,Aamir,I would highly recommend Robert's place. The whole house is a beautiful and eclectic collection of art and furniture that is worth admiring. Robert was extremely helpful in getting any issues sorted out and he made sure our stay was nothing less than comfortable.

20292902,415861641,2019-02-23,182654255,Stephanie,"Perfect room for two! Stephanie has great amenities for a great price! Although we did not use them all, she still has them available. She is super friendly. I loved the chocolate she had available in the room, the water ready to drink, and was excited to see she had a bath bomb, but did not end up using it. Overall great experience!"
16589595,127859945,2017-01-21,108416210,Nasser,"It was a pleasure staying in Dan and Tiela house. Very organized, clean, and welcoming people. I just can say it is a 5 stars house and encourage everybody to book with them. Miss you friends"

13969736,96966255,2016-08-25,82159719,Chris,"Jacob's space was awesome and comfortable.  We stayed there over a week and it served us well.  He made sure to let us know to ask if we needed anything, but was also very unobtrusive.  The location is in a quiet nice neighborhood and within driving distance of a lot of cool places.  If you have never been to Denver, make sure you rent a car."
17845387,230971447,2018-01-29,940390,Derrell,Exceeds all expectations.  The amenities made for a very comfortable stay. Karen and her family were warm but never intrusive. Would highly recommend to anyone.

98008,50395077,2015-10-11,5149791,Barbara,"My review can only repeat what others' have written - that this house (home) is a beautifully restored Queen Anne that sends you back to  the turn of the (20th) century - but with modern amenities!  The location lets you walk to nearby terrific restaurants and attractions if you wish, though it's fun just walking around the neighborhood to view other restorations and beautiful front-yard gardens.  Plus, Jim is exceedingly gracious and accommodating.  He will give you tips on things to see and do, and offer directions on the best way to get to them! Plus, he truly means it when he says to make yourself at home.  This is a unique airbnb experience, made possible by Jim's hospitality."
24778264,457274842,2019-05-23,110160614,Benjamin,It was just as advertised! Quick response! Washer and dryer a huge plus! Quiet!
2817786,528265810,2019-09-12,50934271,Pete,"Perfect location in Denver.  One block from market, pharmacy, and dry cleaners.  Within 4 blocks of rec facilty, restaurants and shops.  Within one mile from train station, pro sports venues, 16th street mall.  Well appointed home, in mature landscape neighborhood, with lots of things to do!"
23557779,359697445,2018-12-17,114239683,Stephen,"This spot is in a great location. I was able to walk to several great restaurants, and anything not in walking distance was close enough for a very cheap uber ride. The place has excellent decor and was very clean. Tim was quick to respond to any questions I had. I’d definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice stay in the city."
21865169,313608046,2018-08-25,14423455,Patrick,"We really enjoyed staying at Shalom and Jonathan's place. The house was nice, well equipped and decorated, and clean when we arrived. It had plenty of room for our large group. It's in a convenient location for car-based travel around the Denver area.  I appreciated the hosts' thorough and detailed communication, and their quick responses. Thanks guys, and maybe see you again next time we're in Denver!"
23452346,265938957,2018-05-18,76397998,Shaylee,"Michelle and Stephen's place was fabulous. It was sparkling clean, newly updated, complete privacy, easy directions, and they communicated super fast!

13764044,323464993,2018-09-15,36431098,Whitney,"I had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Maria and Scott’s place. This was my first trip to Denver and their place was great! Super cute, spotless, and centrally located for my work conference. I love that it’s so close to a mall, too!"
17405963,244875677,2018-03-19,122948744,Feodosia,"LOVED our stay! He was very kind and helpful, the place was nice, super clean and sooo close to downtown without actually being downtown. Definitely what I was looking for since I had my dogs with me. Very huge plus having a decent sized fully fenced back yard. Didn’t even hear the neighbors, and when we wanted to go out it was just a $5 uber ride to popular bars. Would definitely stay here again, probably one of the best air bnbs I’ve stayed in so far. Overall I give it five stars."
24262468,340077506,2018-10-22,210843003,Sierra,"Clean, tastefully and artfully decorated, with all the amenities of home and more!

We walked to and from the convention center, it was a nice walk besides having to wait for the crosswalk lights to change. Give yourself a few extra minutes for that. There is a Starbucks for coffee each morning right by the house which was nice. The space itself is really great, Mike has many nice touches ready for guests, he has thought of everything! The light rail train has a stop quite near the house that will take you downtown where all the action is. Thanks Mike for the great stay, we’ll be back!"

Ryan was attentive throughout the entire process. I even had something shipped to his house from Amazon, and he left it on our doorstep! We were a little nervous to stay below an owner with a dog because we had s bad experience before, but we NEVER heard Ryan's sweet dog. When we come back to Denver, we'll stay here again!"

Erika's home was clean, prepared, and had all of the necessities (including the ones travelers often forget) readily available and easy to find and use. The house was a nice walk or quick Uber ride to many restaurants and bars in the area, but was separated enough from all of the attractions to ensure we had quiet in the evenings when we needed to sleep.

I'd greatly recommend Erika for anyone traveling to the Denver area!"

We felt at home the minute we got there and were sad when we had to leave. That says it all-it was wonderful!

Sam’s tips were right on the money and really did help us sort out a plan of what to do in the area."
7899712,53439733,2015-11-08,31813705,Leslie W.,"Dan and Jon are stellar host who went above and beyond during my stay. They lavished me with home cooked meals and offered rides to make sure my stay was very enjoyable & carefree. 

The room itself is on the top level of the home and is secluded from the rest of the house for extra privacy.  The room is larger than it appears in photos and has a great set up for watching TV / lounging or doing work, in addition to a very comfortable bed to lay your head after a day of exploring Denver.  The bathroom is huge with a nice standup shower and jacuzzi bathtub (with plenty of salts to really chill out).

The property is centrally located so you can easily hop to Cherry Creek or downtown amongst other neighboring areas.

Can’t say enough good things about the host and the home has a very laid back vibe & open feel.  Highly recommended!!! "
29283226,533433344,2019-09-21,180000655,Monica,"If you’re looking for a magical place, look no further. I fell in love the moment I stepped through her fence doors. She has a beautiful outside area and very spacious. We enjoyed many nights out there during our stay. It was comfortable and perfect for Instagram photo sessions. Now for the inside, just WOW! It was beyond beautiful, I was left speechless. The kitchen was AMAZING, I could not stop taking pictures. The bedrooms were nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable and clean! the bathroom decorations looked as if they belonged to the royal family. The color schemes were on point!!! If I could describe what this place looked like. I’d say it looks like a modern cottage. Also the area it’s located in, is the best!! Near so many things. As for the lovely host, she was very sweet and helpful. I couldn’t have asked for a better host!! I definitely look forward to the day I can return!!"
28464192,348059291,2018-11-12,36789043,Erica,Super close to so many great spots in the neighborhood! Easy to park right at the front door and very cozy inside.

30955430,559731334,2019-11-04,77747654,J.R.,"Fabulous entertaining house with large open kitchen/dining room. Bedrooms are spacious enough with comfortable beds/linens. Kitchen was stocked with adequate dishes/silverware but could always use more. Regular coffee maker should be larger although the Keurig coffee maker with select coffees  was a nice surprise.  No ice maker in the freezer which should be addressed. The sofa bed on the 3rd floor was broken and unusable; definite issue when counting on that space. We were lacking electrical power in one bathroom (plugs/lights) for the 1st day and it took over 24 hours to get it corrected. 
Location is fantastic with plenty within walking distance.  We especially enjoyed Gaetano's Italian restaurant up the street.
Overall this home is definitely a pleasure to stay at and would recommend it to others assuming the few things mentioned above are corrected."

There was even a HUGE walk-in closet with all kinds of storage in the suite. The wifi was strong, the flat screen tv in the bedroom had Netflix, Hulu, etc.  Aneel and Preety are friendly and helpful, and gave us many useful tips. Our interest in coming to Denver was to take day-trips to Pike's Peak, Rocky Mountain National Park, Lookout Mountain, etc.  The location of the condo was great for this, as well as for taking in the sights and offerings of Denver.  Highly recommended."
32308946,436683311,2019-04-13,109651284,Bailee,"Its very rare to find an Airbnb that blows your (already high) expectations out of the water. Staying at Candice’s space was a highlight of our trip here to Denver. The space is absolutely breathtaking, filled with detailed artwork, a fabulous bathroom, a comfy bed, and enough space to feel right at home. 
Her pets are an absolute delight to be around and Candice herself is such a kind, present, and humble human. 
Our time staying with Candice is a memory we will hold onto!"

It also has everything you need for a comfortable stay. I recommend his place to anyone traveling to the area."
3992779,56503145,2015-12-14,48339009,Laura,"The place was on the small side but had everything that was needed. It is in a nice neighborhood that you can feel safe walking anytime to restaurants, bars or any of the stores nearby. They could not have been nicer and it was a perfect place for us since it was only a two block walk to our daughter's apartment."
27432059,314497139,2018-08-26,164385269,Reagan,"Though only here for a few days, this cozy little cottage served as a home for laughter and celebration. Thank you, Sarah, from the bottom of my heart for allowing us to stay in this space and cultivate lasting memories and friendships. :) "

8444190,438841736,2019-04-17,251094935,Arturo AJ,"Very cool vintage spot! Definitely a Denver experience we won’t forget and loved!!  Emily’s place was interesting and beautiful, with antique touches and Victorian vibes, we loved her personal touches.  The balcony and stained glass windows were two of our favorite things!"
17210049,408212627,2019-02-03,173379529,Mark,We were pleasantly surprised with the unit.  So modern and welcoming in the center of an up-n-coming neighborhood full of charm.  The place was super clean.  Great value.

27167152,502650110,2019-08-04,69296957,Corrie,Kevin's place is very clean and located in a very quiet neighborhood. The park at the end of the street is great for children. If we are back in Denver and need a place to stay we will pick Kevin's place first.
30824000,463676163,2019-06-03,15497301,Joe,"Cozy and quaint garden/basement space. Well lit and with a beautiful kitchen. Ryan and Brittany were great and helpful. As someone looking to just have a quiet place to rest their head for a few days exploring a new city, it was exactly what I needed. 

The only thing I would say is that it is not the most walkable area in town—you’ll be looking at a good 20-30 minute stroll to grab a morning coffee or anything like that. 

Overall, it was a nice stay and the hosts were very gracious and helpful."
833937,7133680,2013-09-08,2521632,Virginia (Ginger),"Loved the house, had a great stay in Denver; the cottage was fun and functional, and we really loved the little coffee shop around the corner called Purple Door Coffee.  Not only are they great for coffee and eats, but it turns out they have a mission other than profit--they raise money for work with young people in urban Denver.  Eliza was a great host and we would stay there again.  Location is very close (2 blocks) from light rail!"
19366977,218273619,2017-12-11,4644719,Tina,"Dan's beautifully furnished and squeaky clean apartment was perfect for a quick trip to Denver. The location was great for our group to go out for coffee, drinks, dinner, etc. thanks for Dan's list of recommendations in the neighborhood. The fenced in yard was a nice addition for our dog. Dan was quick to respond to questions and was flexible when meeting us to check-in. He even provided brand new towels when the washer was malfunctioning. The hospitality was top notch!"

1042331,245096239,2018-03-20,58513681,Taylor,"Annette was a wonderful host. When we arrived she was there to greet us and our pups. From then on, we went in and out of our little apartment (she has a couple of them on the side of her house) as we pleased. Any time we had questions, we texted her and she texted right back. Her place was all that we needed - a living room, bathroom, full kitchen, and bedroom. It is also located close to everything in Denver. Highly recommend!"
33526716,475729010,2019-06-24,240810901,Jennifer,"Great place, great location! We could walk to the park or go grab a quick bite within walking distance. Quick and great communication with Meachelle. We look forward to booking our next trip with her."

35640219,476234006,2019-06-25,74787907,Amy,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We weren't expecting the bed to be in a cave-like room with a low ceiling but it ended up being fine.  Waking up and being able to cross the street to Common Grounds for a great cup of coffee was a treat!  We loved the location and neighborhood feel.  We also walked to Bacon Social House and El Jefe for dinner.   Both were yummy!
24676921,277172065,2018-06-15,9483834,Sarah,"Much to our surprise, we got to meet Rebecca. Because of a scheduling mix up with the property management company, she was home when we arrived. She was so kind and helped us get the situation completely sorted very quickly. Despite the confusion, I'm very glad we got to meet her. She is an artist and it's always lovely to make a connection with the people who made a house a home. Rebecca and Christian's place was gorgeous and I'm nothing but thrilled by the stay - especially the proximity to the RINO Arts District. So many lovely places are walkable from this spot. Thanks for the kindness and hospitality. Would definitely stay again."
21141369,475154532,2019-06-23,93233951,Karla,"Brad's place is perfect.  Convenient proximity to major venues but in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood for a very enjoyable get-away."

It can be a little noisy outside the apartment with the windows open but other than that everything was great."
30353391,401097354,2019-01-13,233886614,Halle,"Best airbnb! Steve and Kathleen are the nicest people i’ve met! Very great at communicating, tips, etc. Myself, my boyfriend, and our out of state friends felt right at home with the wonderful hospitality! Their home was hands down amazing. very home-like atmosphere along with friendly appliances and nice home in general!  This is a nice little get away to have some fun in denver as well as having a cozy night in a perfect home. The beds were comfortable sheets were soft, heating was perfect. Living room was perfect sized. Cleanliness is important to me and this place was sparkling! Best place to be at home away from home. Will rent again no doubt!  10/10 
Thanks again!"
236207,1587101,2012-06-29,2277908,Sarah,I have had a great experience working with Dave and staying in his amazing loft. The location is perfect and the loft exceeded my expectations. Dave has been a gracious host and so great to work with!  You can't beat the view from the patio! 
21324862,241332097,2018-03-08,61783879,Emilia,Hotel-like apartment in a very good location. It's a bit noisy and I've used the earplugs that were provided.

The location to downtown is great and there is tips inside on local things to do. We would stay here again.
21726072,401155201,2019-01-13,181260684,David,"If you are thinking of booking Joe's place stop thinking and do it already! You won't regret it. Close to everything, full of style and personality, and impeccably clean. Definitely recommend it!"
16733876,563060374,2019-11-11,153558647,Evelyn,"As described, it is a private basement apartment. It is located in a quiet neighborhood. It is literally about a 10 minute drive from downtown. It’s good place to stay if you’re visiting Denver for a couple of days. Carissa was communicative and responsive and that is always a plus!"
2267500,36454482,2015-06-28,8086295,Amy,Really lovely little place in the best part of Denver. Cory and his wife are great hosts and I highly recommend staying at there home!

We even spent one day working from home in the apartment, and the wifi was fast and we appreciated having a desk to put our laptops. Sean even went out of his way to bring us bottles of water, which were just what we needed after drinking all the delicious Denver beers all day :) Thank you Sean for everything!"

20624536,231133737,2018-01-30,150496768,Lyndsey,The Blue Ox was a perfect home away from home for our trip to Denver! Loved the stylish touches and the sounding community!
20624536,220986360,2017-12-24,22458644,Susie,"The location was great for us and convenient to grocery stores and restaurants.  We visited friends/family in Brighton and Castle Rock and both areas were approx. 30 minutes away.

We had four adults and the home was very comfortable.  We did a lot of our cooking on-site.  The washer and dryer was awesome and we appreciated the amenity.  We also appreciated the high-end bedding and towels — nice touch.

Josh and a Kerrie were great hosts and very responsive.  We would recommend this property and would stay there again."
14488549,156449268,2017-05-30,39174461,Brittney,"This place is phenomenal. It is as described and looks better than the pictures in person. Definitely has that artist vibe . The location couldn't be better. I was in town for a convention and it was 2 blocks away from the convention center and cheaper than the discounted price of the hotel for convention attendees. We got some groceries at a market down the street and cooked breakfast there. We ate out at several restaurants within walking distance for lunch and dinner. We didn't have time really to watch any DVDs but this place has an AMAZING book and DVD collection. It is eclectic, so there is something for everyone. The bathroom light was out above the shower when we arrived (I don't care to complain about such things), but it's a large, double shower which makes up for it. Some people may be put off by the black sink and toilet only bc it so easily shows use after you get ready in the morning. However, there is a ton of cleaning supplies if this bothers you. The balcony wasn't a great view, but I still enjoyed it. The living room and TV were great. The speakers are very loud, as described in the listing. The walls are thin, so if you are a light sleeper you should be aware that you can hear your neighbors. Again, this didn't bother me but to some it might. The best part was the bed.  OMG SOOO COMFY!!! Plus it's in the loft area. I just felt that it was very peaceful.  I really enjoyed staying here and would be back should I visit anytime soon! I communicated with a girl who was managing the apartment via text. She responded very promptly, and allowed us to leave our bags there while we explored 
 downtown. We landed in the airport at 10 and check in was in the afternoon. It was nice to be able to leave our bags and go to lunch.

Towels were available and that helped me pack less, which was awesome. The bed was super comfy and the room was nice and simple. it was lovely. I didnt see much of the hosts, and that was okay. I felt safe staying at the residence. Would stay here again."

His home is also clean and modern, as well as situated in a quiet neighborhood. It was great to have a private bedroom with the additional lounging space of the 1st floor. A friend and I stayed at his place for a few days and really felt a sense of hospitality: Gerry would check in with us from time to time to see how we were doing, but always in a very caring way.

Highly recommended - don't hesitate to stay here on your next trip to Denver!"

He gave us some superb recommendations on where to eat, places to shop and sights to see. Even though he was very busy, playing Xbox he took the time to help us out on every occasion. We also enjoyed his very comfortable house , which is in the most convenient location. If you are in Denver , you must stay at Peter in the heart of the center.
Top-notch AirBnB experience, polite and accurate communication combined with elegant and well located area.
Peter was a superb host. He gave us clear instructions for getting to the house , and left a helpful collection of notes for us to use.Stay here again for this unbeatable price."
3458369,19052191,2014-09-05,20372201,Derrick,Jamie and her husband were wonderful hosts. They were even flexible with a tight schedule on their calendar. The place was unbelievable and I would definitely recommend it to others coming to Denver. 
34570436,486513430,2019-07-12,243773803,Betsy,"Perfect for what we needed. Great price for 7 of us. Very walkable to Trader Joe’s, Starbucks and restaurants. 
Great host communications.
Easy late night entrance. 
Not fancy but just right. Would stay again if in the area."

10190798,122940283,2016-12-26,52702168,Charmaine,"Richard's place is exactly how it looks in the photos. It's a bit small, but was ample for four adults. Very modern furnishings and convenient street parking. I will say that the bedroom next to the bathroom was chilly and the heat didn't seem to quite reach. Don't expect quick responses from Richard-he was friendly enough but you'll need to send a follow up message to get an answer. All in all, a great place to stay and a very good deal! "
39405,430490603,2019-03-30,118127671,Jaime,Very pleased with our stay! Everything was taken care of and the place has such a wonderful feel. Recommend this place to anyone lots of local tips as well!

3338717,15119119,2014-07-02,7597730,Alyssa,"This place is beautiful, clean, in a great location, and comes with an amazing host (not to mention a full kitchen and washer and dryer). 

My husband and I stayed a few days at Nanci's while looking for a house/apartment to rent. We're moving to the Denver area and would have been totally lost without Nanci's advice! She was amazingly helpful, but never invasive. She gave us great advice on neighborhoods as well as eateries, coffee shops and activities we should check out (along with a map). South Pearle Street is within walking distance and the park across the street is awesome! I couldn't have been more pleased with this rental. I'll be recommend Nanci's place to all of our friends and family that can't fit in our new place when they come to visit!
"
4263714,66563438,2016-03-23,60013522,Sophie,"Melissa and John were lovely hosts with a lovely home! They gave great recommendations for food in the surrounding area and were flexible as well. I slept like a baby, and had an awesome time exploring Denver. Teddy was adorable too, as long as you don't mind the occasional bark, which I don't. :) I am grateful to have had the joy of staying with this family, and I rate them well."

19441412,279120713,2018-06-19,11910073,Zach,Very stylish loft with everything you need and more. Short uber ride to a lot of amazing places that Denver has to offer.  Parts of the RiNo neighborhood are walkable from here. Sheik was very accommodating and had great recommendations.  If I’m in the area again I will definitely keep an eye out for Sheiks place. 
21684842,505752651,2019-08-09,80250885,Shelby,We loved staying at Ed and Kate’s. The house was so cute and the check in was so easy. The space is clean and has lots of extra pillows and blankets.

21580126,301191049,2018-08-03,67595255,Megan,"I highly recommend a stay at this adorable little house. It was just the right size for my small family. It was very clean and modern on the inside, and the beds were super comfy. Although the street it's on appears less than desirable, we never felt unsafe and enjoyed the very close proximity to downtown, the zoo, restaurants, etc. Great value! "
25477926,534508857,2019-09-22,228242741,Allan,"The apartment was wonderful and Toby was an excellent host. The apartment was perfect for my wife and I but easily had enough room for another couple. The space was beautifully decorated and Toby was very communicative. Next time I'm in Denver, I would definitely stay with Toby again!"
21816001,353140822,2018-11-26,184141524,Barbara,"This is a perfect little Hideaway for 2! It was clean, comfortable, and affordable. The room had a lot of cute little touches including coffee pot. The breakfast foods were a ni e touch too. Another family member was in the room next door so it was just a wonderful experience for the four of us. We will be back when we get to come back to Denver! Thanks!"
3979810,67146022,2016-03-27,28050136,Renee,"Anthony was very responsive to my communications and even accommodated our earlier arrival. The house was in a great location and presented just as advertised. It was perfect for my family of 6 adults. The backyard was wonderful and our dogs enjoyed it immensely. The house was stocked with towels and linens and the kitchen even had coffee!  We never met Anthony, but then again we had no problems. I would highly recommend this house."
27174706,358768264,2018-12-15,230219787,Jocelyn,Will definitely be back!
21190064,313083478,2018-08-24,209794528,Jasmina,I liked staying here if you’ll only be here for sleeping guests next door would come in and out and SLAM the door when they would go to and from the bathroom won’t be staying again but it’s a good place if you’re used to noise

30071949,525343717,2019-09-07,30104142,Tatyana,"The place for great accommodation for our needs. We had a party of 6 staying and just needed a place to sleep. It was very clean, beds were comfortable and the host quick to respond to our questions. As other people say we could hear the upstairs, and woke up a few times at night because of the dog running. Also, beware that AC unit is controlled by the host upstairs and it could get cold downstairs. The AC was blowing right in our heads one night, it was somewhat hot outside, and it was hard to warm up and fall asleep. Other then that everything was good. 
Thank you Alisha :)"
11789571,300695363,2018-08-02,102073123,Lorie,"This place was not fancy but very classy. Improvements in just the right places! Very good mattresses, good linens and pillows. A good dishwasher. Good laundry machines. Nice tv. Great location!! I will look to stay here again when I visit Denver. Thank you! I was very comfortable staying here. "
16860906,203242197,2017-10-14,27710273,Molly,"Great place in a great location.  The neighborhood is very trendy and has great restaurants and shops.   It is very close to downtown.  There is a lot of space and sleeps four people very comfortably and 6-8 somewhat comfortably on pull out beds, etc.  The rooftop deck is super cozy and a fun place to sit and (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Daniel was quick and he got right back to us in regard to any questions that we had.  I highly recommend this spot for a cozy Denver stay."
30463025,427463365,2019-03-23,156360098,Alyssa,An absolutely lovely experience all around. So close to everything! Ellyce was responsive and so sweet. I will book their studio again in the future for sure.

24183381,538442787,2019-09-29,269033615,Maddie,"Great location. Rooftop deck was wonderful. Pipes are very loud as others have pointed out, but fine if you’re a heavy sleeper. Beds are comfy and the kitchen is nice. It’s a great place to host a group of people."

18002228,185041807,2017-08-20,20705827,Loretta,Gorgeous apartment with funky flair. Patio is a plus and it's walking distance to some cute restaurants and quick driving distance to hip places so free parking is a bonus. Nice refuge from the Denver summer heat!
30759386,459826332,2019-05-27,236395246,Jackie,Amelia's place was the perfect space for our Denver getaway! Check-in was a breeze and Amelia went above and beyond to ensure our Denver trip was great. We had 3 folks staying here and we all agreed this was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had!
8427693,133969559,2017-02-25,112961118,Jackson,"This was our first airbnb and it was a great experience. Going into it we were a bit reluctant but the house was beautiful and clean. Matt and Vicky were so kind and welcoming. They were always present to give recommendations for local restaurant but also gave us the privacy we wanted. It was way better than a hotel, wouldn't have had it any other way! Highly recommend this airbnb for anyone visiting Colorado and hoping to experience Denver! "

31013216,454584454,2019-05-18,47760944,Travis,"Check in was delayed due to the room not being clean yet. Sound travels easily through the space, making this a not particularly quiet stay. Hosts were kind and generous."
662431,185796369,2017-08-22,59221849,Rumour,"Wonderful stay! The location is fantastic! The studio was well appointed and smartly decorated with all of the comforts of home! It can be a little noisy if there is a family is staying above you, but Tim provided a sound machine and ear plugs to help with reduce noise. Would definitely stay again!"
13657498,114316548,2016-11-17,2929941,Gina & Chris,"Jeff called me and texted instructions so I knew where to arrive. Jeff also was home when I arrived to greet me and introduce me to his (& Sweet's) beautiful, mansion-like home, Additionally, Jeff (a chef in his own right) offered to make breakfast the next morning, which normally is not a high priority, however it was enticing enough that I thought YES, a perfect beginning to the new day. Thanks Jeff for a great visit!"
18250654,450165411,2019-05-08,84317553,Melissa,"Zachary was a great host! He and Ebone had lots of good suggestions of things to do in the Denver area, and they were responsive and easily accessible. The apartment complex is a short walk to the city center. The room is as described, and the bathroom is private."
10343072,308077101,2018-08-15,26815852,John,Allison was the perfect host. Very clean place in a cool neighborhood. Walkable to a lot of restaurants and bars. Would stay again.

Although we did not meet, we felt extremely comfortable with all the check-in instructions, including key retrieval and parking. The apartment was absolutely lovely. Quiet, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood. It was close to downtown Denver and very easy to access the surrounding mountains, rivers, and hiking.

We would definitely recommend Katey and the apartment to all Denver travelers!"

18227184,179137980,2017-08-06,28782798,Alison,"I loved the superb parking spot right at the door, the perfectly air conditioned room with a new mattress, easy communication with Mathew and Patrick, private bathroom, and of course the roof, which I used for yoga and decompressing in between outings. I walked to a juice bar, yoga studio and cafe nearby, and otherwise used Uber. The next door construction was no big deal on the weekend at all, and I slept very soundly. It was clean and although I didn't take advantage of the kitchen,  it looked like a great space to use if I wanted to cook. I like how we all just did our own thing but yet they were available and kind when we did see one another. Good deal!"
26985504,441249527,2019-04-21,25149372,Richard,"This is an ideal place to stay; clean, quiet and set up nicely with everything a traveler or two might need.  A quiet residential neighborhood on the North side of Denver with easy access to local businesses for dining, shopping, etc. Pedestrian friendly planned neighborhood with safe, connecting walkways for miles. Close to green space, parks and trails."

27432643,330643400,2018-09-30,176446639,Whitney,Great communication and clean place! Less than a block from a awesome coffee place! We enjoyed our stay at Amy and Sarah’s place and would definitely stay again!
13624842,309149032,2018-08-17,11542417,Julie,awesome location in rino. I would say perfect for 1-2 travelers. I was by myself and it was felt like a home away from home! you can walk to a number of bars and restaurants. 2 thumbs up

The apartment was perfect, exactly as described, quiet, and comfortable. Carrie was very friendly and immediately available for any questions we had during our stay.

18843560,307609248,2018-08-14,68844624,Matthew,"I enjoyed my stay here, and I gave it five stars, because that is accurate.  That being said, I'd imagine this place is not for everyone.    It was my first AirBnB stay where the host was actively in the house, so that was different for me.     It was as advertised, however travellers should know that the host will be there.   Their cats are wonderful, but if you are allergic, this may not be the place for you.   Had to keep bedroom door closed, to keep cat's out (per host).

All of that said, it was a nice stay.   Dana was a wonderful host, and always friendly, with good suggestions of where to eat and go.    The bed was comfy, and I had what I needed in the house.   I particularly enjoyed coffee on the patio every morning, and the ability to set up my ""office"" there, and make my work calls from their wonderful porch (really nice back-yard).

I think it's a wonderful place for the right traveller.  If you are looking to party hard, and come home to an empty house where you could be wild, this place is probably not for you.  If you need a quiet place to stay (neighbors can be a bit loud, as mentioned in other reviews, it did not bother me), with a comfy bed, and easy access to much of Denver, it's a good place.

Like I said""   5-stars for the right person."
13414484,113966532,2016-11-14,103182918,Monica,"Cal and Dave were superb hosts!! My boyfriend and I decided to take a last minute mini vacation to Denver and Cal was flexible enough to book us last minute. The room was exactly as the pictures looked, but even better in person. The bed was amazingly comfortable--we ended up sleeping in 2 hours past our original planned wake up time because we just could not get up! Not to mention there was also plenty of channels on tv for us to watch after a long day back from the Rockies. Their dogs, Dillon and Oakley, were extremely friendly as well. The house is a 4-story building--basement level is the suite, ground level is the gym and a living room, second level is the kitchen/common areas, third level is their private room and the fourth level is the rooftop, equipped with a hot tub and awesome view of the downtown skyline!!! We especially loved how the room was located on the bottom level for extra privacy. If only we stayed longer, we would've definitely used the gym and hot tub. Can't wait to come back and stay with them again!!"
6488535,220512799,2017-12-22,53492976,Emily,I was extremely pleased with my stay. The apartment was in the perfect location to explore and enjoy everything Denver had to offer. Brandon and Robert were awesome hosts and had all my questions answered before I even thought to ask!

So many thoughtful details throughout the entire place! Unfortunately it got cold and snowy on my trip so I took advantage of that fireplace and it made it so cozy! I never wanted to leave this place it’s like home away from home! Thank you for my best experience yet! Can’t wait to come back again! BOOK THIS PLACE! You won’t regret it!

7790834,210914496,2017-11-11,6918173,Jp,Samantha’s place was perfect for our week long getaway in Denver. We were a short walk from 16th ave where the downtown fun starts. Just around the corner from her place is a very nice selection of food and drinks. Diebolt Brewing just up the road is a must try if you are into beer.
13789731,315363804,2018-08-28,88719311,Bryan,Great place. Very spacious and the two bedrooms aren't close so there is some privacy. Highly recommend.

Easy parking for the car, the appartment is very practicle, full equiped with everything we needed, kitchen, ovens, immediatly you feel at home, fridge, washing and drying machine for our clothes, tv and wifi, all were available, coffe,tea, two bedrooms, salon .....
It was a pleasure, not mentioned by daniel but important : at 10 minutes by foot : the bus station , the mexican shopping center including their super market and bakery, several other super markets around the flat 15-20 minutes bu foot, the vietnamese district with many retaurants very good and practicle, top for shopping and food, the oil station.

34616832,535998863,2019-09-25,229165723,Leo,"This is a great looking place, honestly the pictures don't do it justice. It's a short walk from the heart of downtown. The hosts, Maria and Scott could not have been more accommodating and responsive. I cannot recommend this place enough."
23236575,449461660,2019-05-06,35307349,Chelsea,"This is an amazing studio,  you read studio and think it’s going to be small but this studio is amazing with great space.  

The things that really made me fall in love is the cute patio that hangs above a backyard, just really cozy and peaceful.  The neighborhood is lively but it’s also surprisingly calm.  
 Another addition I loved was the huge tub.  I did a lot of walking and some hiking and my legs were hating me.  I took a long hot bath with the jets and felt amazing afterwards. 

The bed is comfy and there are plenty of areas to put your things away while staying. 

I loved this place and will be back!"
3968613,197102615,2017-09-24,11189500,Christopher,"Erika's place is full of interesting books, magazines, art and supplies. She's located close to many great bars and restaurants, away from downtown but close enough to walk to. Her cats keep to themselves and the place is very clean. Erika is very welcoming and friendly. Please don't go there to be loud and obnoxious. Thanks"

En cuanto al anfitrión es una persona atenta, respetuosa; cálida y amigable. Su trato hacia mi persona fue excepcional y tiene una perrita hermosa."
8427693,80028642,2016-06-15,29219930,Angie,Matt and Vicki were wonderful hosts!  They were fast at responding to my questions.  Their home was wonderful. We truly felt like we lived in Denver for those 5 days.  They were sociable but also respected our privacy! We will definitely stay with them again next year!

29335867,539087945,2019-09-30,198735864,Randy,"This place really is top notch.   The listing didnt do it justice.   For being out of state on business,  I cannot imagine being any more comfortable than we were as everything was thought out to the T when the house was equipped to rent as a BnB..  Super clean, price was perfect, modern and comfy..   My company will use this place againg when we travel for next years convention..    It is a downplay when I say this place is a gem and a real treat while on the road.    I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."
17251698,310529652,2018-08-19,20827591,Chris,Michael and Connie’s place is perfect for people looking for a simple garden level apartment in central location. They were wonderful hosts and were readily available whenever I had a question. Their place is within easy walking distance to restaurants and bars. It’s a very safe and beautiful neighborhood. We had a great time and would stay again with them!
3992452,459007079,2019-05-26,182324060,Katie,Absolutely loved the location! John is super friendly and went above my expectations. There was plenty of space for my and my three friends. Great out door space and nice neighbors. Would recommend.
13579869,165048048,2017-06-30,10829098,Ronny,"A big House with plenty of room. It's located by a few restaurants, a grocery store and next to a busy street ,so watch for crazy drivers. The house is a little dirty and could use a deep cleaning but the beds are comfy. Would recommend if on a budget or traveling through town."
36385550,550968716,2019-10-19,302095734,Allison,Room with private bathroom very clean and location not far from downtown Denver

17831437,426291757,2019-03-20,236566057,Sheryl,"This is a fantastic find.  Both Jason and Cate were very quick to respond to my questions.  The condo was absolutely wonderful and had everything we needed.  It was quiet and very stylish.  With a grocery store right around the corner, once we parked we had little reason to leave.  Parking is the one very minor issue, but when I say minor, I mean minor.  We had little trouble finding a space in the street.  I highly recommend this place."
25372201,517833173,2019-08-25,238997775,Joseph,She is so rude and unprofessional
34474444,511652866,2019-08-17,67775202,Melissa,"Sweet home, well decorated and situated, and has everything you need to cook of which my family took full advantage. The backyard is lovely to enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is an old house so bathroom fixture/draining is a little slow. Other than that, a wonderful welcoming spot for a couple or small family. Would stay again for sure!"
12889829,201141956,2017-10-07,72100471,Aaron,We had a great stay at David’s place. It was clean with easy access to downtown. The home had all the amenities you need.

3487191,133445547,2017-02-22,102011912,Amiee,Amazing location! We were able to rent b cycles ~3 blocks away and we cycled across town to 16th Street Mall and the Highlands in less than 30 mins via the Cherry Creek Trail. We were out after dark walking Broadway and even back to the carriage house without any worries. Awesome local restaurants. Met the owner once in passing in the driveway but we didn't need a thing courtesy of a well equipped rental and ideal location. 
23642743,307606561,2018-08-14,35520402,Eva,"This place is an excellent value, an looks exactly like the photos. We were able to make coffee each morning and could have made a toast-able breakfast if we wanted even though there’s no real kitchen. Check-in was super easy and flexible. One thing to note that is that you will definitely hear the tenants upstairs - they luckily weren’t around too much while we were but we could definitely hear every footstep and bits of conversation. All in all though it’s a solid spot to book!"
16742127,236151453,2018-02-18,53157844,Cory,Tammis place was stylish and clean with sweet touches and all the convenience of the city!
25477072,325429434,2018-09-19,121222558,Mary,I would highly recommend Lamark’s spot. The room was clean and Lamarck went out of his way to make his guests comfortable. 10/10!
12990793,451349658,2019-05-11,151576681,Adriel,Beautiful home with all you need for two exploring Denver and RiNo with everything being a short Uber or quick drive with a rental car to wherever. The jetted hot tub in the bathroom was hard not to go in every night but I think we did anyway. Plan on staying here again if we come back for the summer or fall.
27797372,444303241,2019-04-27,131558224,Nick,Comfortable space with an amazing bed and bathroom.

17856827,147416953,2017-04-26,33518549,Pat,"This is a beautiful condo in a lovely older building directly next to Cheesmen Park.  The space is light and bright, the kitchen is gorgeous with all amenities one would expect. The neighborhood is very walkable with restaurants and shops nearby.  This is our 4th time staying in a home in Denver (3rd with Airbnb) and is our favorite by far.   Don was very attentive to a minor problem that arose.  We would definitely stay here again!!"
10747925,448808435,2019-05-05,12868438,Daniel,"Billy's house was a beautiful old Victorian, with many amenities including an excellent modern hot tub in the backyard patio area. His host communication was friendly and responsive, and I would stay here again if I get the chance."
11690656,331466165,2018-10-02,92124050,Patrick,"Cool place, we had 4 big dudes and it was plenty of space for us all.  Location was awesome and the friendly cats provided a very ""Homey"" feel.  Cat Friendly, 420 Friendly and very cool to chat with.  Place looked very modern and chill."
15902411,306539058,2018-08-12,166204248,Brielle,"Jessica has a pretty cozy place! She’s super chill to stay with, she provides space to watch television and dishes to use. Her response time is very quick, and she’s very willing to accommodate to your needs. The bedroom was a tad smaller than we expected, but we slept just fine. If you wanna be close to the city for a great price, definitely consider staying here. "
13494022,132568496,2017-02-18,114272818,Ryan,Nice place to stay with outside patio.  Great location for Fillmore concerts or bars/nightlife nearby!
1959836,321115812,2018-09-09,6542579,Crystal,"I really enjoyed my stay at Anne’s place. I just moved to Denver and stayed here while I looked for an apartment. I liked it because it felt more at home. I enjoyed the chance to chat with Anne and her housemate occasionally, and also saying hello to the dog and cat. My room was cozy and comfortable."
13447168,229446710,2018-01-23,166856173,Mariya,The stay was awesome they really go above  and beyond when it comes to making sure you will have everything you need !!

4227772,111300179,2016-10-30,1892571,Matt,"Lynne's place was perfect for our weekend stay. In walking distance to everything. Ended up walking over 10 miles throughout the two days and explored all different parts of the city. Lynne's place was indeed a cozy spot to return to after a long day. Super comfortable bed and nice shower. Love the outdoor seating. We didn't cook any meals in the house, but it has everything you would need to do so. Tons of DVDs and books too if that's your thing. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thanks Lynne! "
3686629,203248042,2017-10-14,41655840,Christina And Jake,Jamie and Maia’s place was perfect for exploring a new city. The location was a quick Uber ride to everywhere we wanted to go. We were able to find nearby street parking easily. Their place was exactly as pictured with really smart use of space. Jamie and Maia were excellent communicators and even gave us suggestions of places to check out on our road trip. Awesome stay!
36596870,559744614,2019-11-04,192385834,Tyler,Great place to stay very close to a lot of businesses! Great place to disconnect from electronics with no tv.
31797581,442504989,2019-04-23,179584712,Loren,"You can’t go wrong with this place! We booked this place for a large group and were blown away from our experience. The place was super clean, comfortable and felt like home. There was seating for everyone  from the couch’s to the dining table (had a group of 11). Brady provided plenty of bath towels, paper towels, blankets, pillows, plates, etc. Care was taken in all of the small details of this place! The beds and comforters were amazing. We all slept well, is an understatement. Brady was extremely prompt at answering any of our questions. I would stay here every time I came to Denver if possible. A 5 star experience!"
30742596,425051626,2019-03-17,73357290,Tiara,"This place was awesome! It was clean, exactly like the pictures, and check-in was super simple. It’s located in the perfect spot in relation to downtown, restaurants, parks, attractions, etc. 

Communication was great—no issues there. My fav part was the bathroom as it has a beautiful shower. The bed was comfy, and there were options for recycling and composting. There’s even a washer and dryer available for use (no iron though). I booked last minute and was able to extend an extra day with no problems. It was just 2 of us, but 4 could easily manage.

There is only one [minor] drawback: since you’re in the basement, you literally hear every foot step above you. However, if you’re not in the unit long, it’s not that big of a deal. I’d imagine they could probably hear us and our music, too (if so, sorry)."
24066553,334333861,2018-10-08,71736353,Kellie,"Wayne's place was centrally located, spacious and had all of the amenities as described.  Check in was super easy and he offered some great suggestions of things to check out around the neighborhood.  Would stay again."
11277311,104959373,2016-09-29,6765889,Aviva & Marcelo,"We stayed at Teddy's home for five nights. He was a very welcoming host from the first text contact and also after we arrived. He helped us with advice about places in the city and was always nice.
The house is in a nice and quite neighborhood, not too far from downtown, so we either walked or took Uber taxis. The room is comfortable and warm and has all we needed and more.
It was a good base for our time in Denver. Thanks, Teddy !!!"
12990793,274280674,2018-06-08,153501411,Klay,"Fantastic place and awesome host! This was our first experience with AirBnb, and we were a bit skeptical about how things would go.  But it was awesome how well Patricia communicated with us throughout our stay.  To help with local dining and grocery locations, Patricia has a book upstairs with the addresses and what to expect at each location.  The place is as awesome as advertised, and would greatly suggest it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Denver area!"
9471950,445137391,2019-04-28,7570677,Melissa,Great place to stay at! The location was close to everything but was also located on a pretty quiet street which was nice.  The host were great and gave some good recommendations on where to eat and drink. I would definitely stay here again.  the one and only suggestion for the light sleepers out there who want to sleep in on their vacation. .  you can here people walking around upstairs. It never bothered us and it was never constant but if your a super light sleeper I could see it being difficult. Other than that everything went as planned and we enjoyed ourselves so much!!

13494205,111557889,2016-10-31,11827262,Charlie,"David was an AMAZING host! Not only was his Townhouse everything we had imagined, but he was a very easy going good guy! Standing on his rooftop patio we felt like all of his neighbors must have ""Rooftop Envy"" because his had everything you could imagine. He was always a call or text away and responded very fast and always made us feel comfortable. We also knew if we needed him for whatever reason he would have made it over there. The townhouse was immpecable upon arrival and he even had a nice basket with information on Denver and a book to write about your experience (We regret forgetting to fill it out.) He made our trip to Denver one of the best trips I have been on, and now he has set the bar high for future AirBnB experiences! Davids place had a fun atmosphere, was in walking distance to everything, and he was beyond accomodating and warm (and funny) to talk to. Next time we're in Denver we'll definitely stay at his place again, but will want to grab a few Denver craft brews with David so we could enjoy him more! FIVE OUT OF FIVE!!!"
18355719,209979741,2017-11-06,123497600,Anahi,"This is by far the best place I’ve stayed at. So many things are walkable or a cheap Lyft ride away.. The house is super clean, (no dust even!). The bed is comfy, the room is private and cozy. Sarah’s decor is on point if you are into plants and a bright welcoming space.  She replies quickly and is really nice. I would recommend this place 100%."
13447168,113269132,2016-11-11,33170923,Rachel,"I loved staying here! This was my first Air BnB experience and I plan on booking with Judy and Marty next time I'm in town! I really felt at home. They have anything you would need and are extremely kind and generous. Also, this was cleaner than any hotel I've ever stayed in. This is the perfect place to stay if you're here for holiday or to unwind after a long day at work! I would recommend this place to anyone!"

Plenty of space for the two of us, with everything we needed to prepare many of our meals.  The location near Washington Park lets you enjoy that part of Denver without dealing with traffic. I hope the apartment is available the next time we come to town!"

Our group got caught in a snowstorm and her house proved to be a very warm shelter from the elements. We were forced to dine in due to the elements, and the ambience her home projected made our dinners amazing. This was our first time ever seeing snow.  We were able to build little snowmen in her back yard along with the requisite snowball fights :)  Truly an experience we will never forget.  Thank you Julie."

915016,134319036,2017-02-26,28306303,Nick,"Tim and Cindy's place was perfect to explore Denver, close to everything. The apartment was as described and Cindy responded to all communication quickly. We definitely recommend to those who want to be close to Capitol Hill area."
25476793,360777290,2018-12-21,196258784,Christopher,"The unit was amazing, Mike was a phenomenal host. We loved the fire place, and we will be back when we come back to Denver. We truly didn't want to leave because of this experience."
2139342,65492675,2016-03-15,39642181,Katherine,"This was our first time in Denver and this was the absolute perfect location for us to stay a few nights! We enjoyed the fireplace, beds were comfortable, and shower was great. If we come back to Denver we will definitely stay again! "
28014823,494694319,2019-07-24,839849,Susan,"Awesome spot that is centrally located.  Super close to downtown and 5points.   House is super cute, beds are comfy, and host is fantastic!"
9471950,152488185,2017-05-16,105166710,Chin Kiong,Great place to stay in Denver! Love the shampoo and lotion they provided!
14902544,250321404,2018-04-04,11260097,Betty,Very comfortable and clean space. Restaurants and REI flagship store is walkable. Instructions were clear and communication very prompt and professional. Thank you for letting us rent out the space!
16440552,482610603,2019-07-06,145188176,Isabella,"Michael was a very friendly and helpful host! The location of his home was awesome because it was a short distance from a lot of places we went out to. There was always parking available in the front of the house. The neighborhood was quiet and cute. We had three people in our group so, my husband and I had the bedroom (queen bed, closet with hangers, extra blanket, fan, mirror) and my brother stayed on the couch in the living room (tv, extra blanket, heater). The bathroom was nice and clean (extra towels and toiletries if needed). We had a very comfortable stay! 
The only flaw was that the AC was on and off and it was cold at some points and we can't control it (which he states in the information), but there is a heater and luckily there were extra blankets! 
We would definitely recommend Michael's place to anyone making a visit to Denver!"
36762379,502392363,2019-08-04,79600314,Maria F,"My husband, friends and I, went to Denver for work and it was the best experience, this place is absolutely clean, comfortable, has everything you need, in a safe area, great communication. The Element is located close to everything, including Downtown. We loved this place, we will definitely stay here again. Thank you."
23684531,327917025,2018-09-24,122199915,Rachel,"Stayed for 4 days in Denver to attend GABF, and visit all our favorite local breweries. The location of this place was awesome - super close to everything downtown, including the convention center, so the Ubers weren't overly expensive. Note: there is an art gallery kind of above, so it was a little on the noisier side, but since we were out most of the day, we didn't have to deal - definitely not detrimental enough to knock my 5 star rating. 

In terms of the place itself: amazing. The overall vibe of Laura's place is mellow, welcoming, and relaxing. We loved the art everywhere! Our room was downstairs - all concrete, no windows, and honestly, one of the best sleeps I've had while traveling! No lights meant I got to enjoy a long night's rest, and actually sleep in for once (usually, natural light wakes me up, even if I don't want to). 

In terms of the host(s): Laura (and Nader!) was awesome. SO welcoming, friendly, warm, and just overall a lovely individual. We really appreciated her hospitality, the little touches for our stay (like having a basked in the bathroom for our toiletries!), and just generally chatting with her. Nader was equally cool to talk to, and we had a great time chatting with our hosts! :)

Thank you SO much Laura and Nader for making our fun Colorado trip even more incredible. 5/5 would recommend this spot to anyone!"
22657843,557715638,2019-11-01,15435886,Jennifer,"This place was a total haven for rest and relaxation - it is beautiful and cozy, and i felt super safe staying solo. I stayed while on a work trip and Jennifer was super understanding of my constantly changing arrival time; I’m so grateful for her flexibility as it took tons of stress off my day. She even made sure to give me advance notice about snow and cold weather that had blown in early so that I packed appropriately. I left Denver feeling more relaxed than when I’d arrived, thanks to the cozy bed and amazing space. It was also within walking distance of bus transit and good food. Highly recommend!!!"
39227604,568761321,2019-11-24,120954996,Christopher,"Tori’s place is excellent and very cozy! Easily accessible from the downtown area. I contacted Tori as we arrived a little earlier than expected, and she was back with a response within a minute. Would highly recommend."
32959758,552913707,2019-10-22,63244371,Jordanna,"Overall had a good experience with this apartment as it was spacious, a great location in the city, and the hosts were very responsive when we had questions. A couple of minor inconveniences though - the elevator was being fixed so we had to climb 13 flights of stairs every day (it’s mentioned in the listing but not quite the extent). There seemed to be some partially used things left behind when we arrived (e.g dirty sponges, used wash cloths, half-eaten granola) and while it wasn’t that big of a deal it just didn’t give us the clean vibe we’ve experienced with other Airbnbs. A few amenities like enough toilet paper/paper towels were also missing but when we reached out they delivered more promptly. Other than that, it met our needs just fine for the long weekend."
23653154,303533575,2018-08-07,145837889,Lilly,"Great stay, Kara is so sweet. 
Very peaceful home she has and sweet cat. I would stay Again. She makes it very easy to check in and out . Close to downtown "
7912052,532891817,2019-09-20,154094347,Caitlin,Aki’s place was okay. The basement was rather musty and the bathroom was 2 floors up. The dog is not friendly and the carpet was stained. Fine for our quick one night stay for a medical trip but would not recommend it for anyone staying longer or wanting to experience Denver nightlife.
23388842,350164503,2018-11-18,33680634,Emma,"Super cute, clean, and well-managed place to stay not too far from all the fun things Denver has to offer."
22544289,422232936,2019-03-10,108156772,Nick,"Great location, great stylish place, the projector was a great touch to watch a few games that we weren't expecting."
6730800,308118653,2018-08-15,131461300,Deirdre,Had at great stay at this Airbnb - tucked into a very sweet and walkable historical neighborhood while only two blocks from the main avenue where you’ll find good food and cool shops. 
1733052,232866564,2018-02-06,89209580,Shawn,Fantastic place and a great location! Jason and Vibeke were gracious hosts!
33160807,468519205,2019-06-12,99557666,Gregory,"There’s no better value for staying downtown in Denver. I will definitely stay at the Stout house every time I’m in town for business or pleasure. 

It’s always a great time meeting other guests and hanging out with Ray or Tami."
33605746,541637539,2019-10-05,57282502,Courtney,"Jesses place is in a great location with supermarket, bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Not far from the main centre of Denver and is a nice walk during the day. We had 4 guests and only stayed 2 nights - the place would have been too small for any more guests especially with there being just 1 small bathroom. The bathroom towels were really small and thin so I’d take your own. Also there is no lock on the bathroom door and we struggled to close some bedroom doors properly. The place was generally clean, with everything you needed in the kitchen and there was enough storage space in each room. I noticed that there were no radiators throughout the apartment so I imagine it gets pretty cold throughout the winter seasons - we were quite cold at night.  On road parking so make sure to read signs closely as we received $50 fine.  Jesse was really responsive and made check in was super easy. Would recommend for short stay in summer."
19489824,292317272,2018-07-17,6152907,Max,"Beautiful, spacious and clean accommodations. Paul really was a super host. He did a great job interacting with me and the other guests. He went above and beyond approving one change I requested and surprising us with a prepared breakfast one morning. Paul cares and it shows!"
18410407,232341952,2018-02-04,64777073,Daryl,"The property was very clean and well kept. It was exactly as shown in the pictures, and my group and I were extremely satisfied with our stay. We would definitely book here again!"
14055472,228994190,2018-01-21,81965484,Matthew,"Came for a 4 day getaway for my 30th bday and was well worth it.  Owner is very available, hospitable, and the house was amazing!  Everything was in order and there was nothing that wasn't already taken care of to make us feel at home.  Highly Recommend!"
15451442,317813111,2018-09-02,17849229,Mike,Great location. Not far from Red Rocks and other great places to visit.
2104774,76483773,2016-05-27,69436965,Naz,"Our stay at Jeanne's was really pleasant. We couldn't ask for anything better. Her flat is exactly as it looks in the pictures, cozy, clean and well-maintained! 
She offers her guests a little gift bag that I find nice and touching! I would say that the kitchen was well equipped. We didn't really cooked but we did have the necessary cooking ware if we wanted to.
The parking was not a problem either.
We were so happy with the place that we decided to extend our stay for two more days, but it was already booked.
We would definitely book her place again if we go back to Denver :)

17699020,193236143,2017-09-12,7452477,Shanta,"This is one of the very best Airbnb rentals I've ever been to. It was immaculately clean, well appointed, and conveniently located. Parking on the street was plentiful, and the proximity to downtown fantastic. Communication was  excellent and getting in to the place was a total cinch. I cannot recommend this highly enough! If/when I return for a visit to Denver I will most definitely try to stay here again."
15409638,112173617,2016-11-04,3881707,Alicia,"Blown away with this high end luxury apartment - if you are used to 5 stars hotels, you won't disappoint. You have your own elevator and the kitchen are huge with high end appliances. Definitely a place if you want to entertain and impress. The dual master bedrooms are not next to each other, which is a bonus if you want your privacy. Parking lots right next to it unlike a lot of downtown apartments where you have to walk 1 or 2 blocks.  You get a private 1 space garage - which is a bonus. 
Right on the edge of downtown and 1 block from the Colorado convention center We spent many hours on the balcony and roof decks as the views are spectacular, both mountain and city views. Adam was an excellent host with prompt and helpful communication and Saeed (check in person) was very welcoming and professional. Sent me a text first thing in the morning"
3685552,32185414,2015-05-15,3022414,Julia,Heather made us feel so welcome and at home!

The house is easy to find (we know this because we checked in late and were able to access easily in the night). Tiffani made sure to send instructions prior to our visit to assure we got in okay. Our stay was extremely pleasant and we felt right at home. The space was clean and all amenities were available to us. We would love to stay here again the next time we're in Denver as we plan to visit much more often! "
98014,34608931,2015-06-09,32761210,Anthony,Everything went very smooth. Everything was as described. Good location and close to downtown. I would stay again for sure. Very accommodating host.
24057621,483628149,2019-07-07,213421976,Stuart,"Rod’s place is in an ideal central Denver location, minutes from great neighborhoods and sightseeing. The house was very comfortable, especially the beds. Rod was very responsive.  Private gated parking in the back was a nice plus too. You’ll love it!"
21412147,254042241,2018-04-15,179166983,Katey,"Friendly and quick responses!
Also, the pup is so cute and loving!"
11690656,208050857,2017-10-30,153583686,Su,Overall I had a great stay at Cassie’s place. She and her animals were welcoming and sweet. I would recommend anyone who loves animals and 420 to stay here. I would also recommend people walk from her place to downtown bc there’s a ton of little shops you’ll miss if you just uber or drive to downtown. It’ll be a decently long walk but I think it’s worth it to really see the details of the city.

13097383,99232431,2016-09-04,60279158,Dylan,I really don't think you could find a better place to stay in Denver for anything close to this price. I cannot think of a single thing that would have improved our stay. I could not recommend Bret's home enough. 
13449331,529377746,2019-09-14,239435785,Matt,Gary's place was fantastic for our business trip. A quiet getaway with great amenities. We had everything we needed and loved the big TV!

16115411,219758255,2017-12-18,1325549,Bryan,"This house is a fantastic value and beautiful living space in a nice neighborhood. Somebody mentioned in an earlier review they felt like they were staying in a MTV Real World house, and I can totally see that after staying here. The interior decorations are extremely stylish. The beds are comfortable and the bedrooms relaxing. Taking a shower under the rain shower head in the ground floor bathroom was a pleasure each morning. I would highly recommend Joe's place to anyone looking for a great, affordable place to stay in Denver."
33940833,465418883,2019-06-07,34870762,James,This place was exactly what I needed for my trip. It was furnished well and had everything I could need. Renting the basement was like having my own apartment.

Waaaay better than hotels and other places we stayed on our trip out to Denver. We couldn’t have been more pleased. Also... the cats are so sweet and love to be around us. Who doesn’t love the extra company?! Perfect place to choose!"

3479122,41618057,2015-08-08,36078429,Jenifer,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at Sam's stylish, unique loft for a week. It was truly a home away from home. The location is ideal, within walking distance of many great restaurants and bars in the LoDo and RiNo neighborhoods, the ballpark, the Sixteenth Street Mall, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and more. A secure, designated parking space was also an asset, as was easy access to the highway. Sam was a terrific host -- quick to respond to any questions, and he provides helpful info about the neighborhood. The keypad entry was also very convenient. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Denver! "
5814645,124325854,2017-01-01,46632434,Marcos,"Upon arriving in Denver for Christmas, we had originally booked a different AirBnB, but after seeing the condition of the house, we quickly contacted customer service and they put us in touch with Alan who was gracious enough to let us stay on short notice. We were at his home for a little over a week and our stay was incredible. The house is beautiful, clean, and in a wonderful location (within walking distance of downtown, a few parks, restaurants, and grocery stores). We met Alan a few days after arriving and he was pleasant as could be, an added bonus to our wonderful experience traveling around Denver. I would thoroughly recommend this home--if you are looking for a convenient and charming AirBnB with an accommodating host for your stay, look no further. "

17714215,270925345,2018-05-30,28697356,Eric,Laura showed amazing hospitality with us during our stay. Always making sure we we're going well. Having two rooms instead of one was welcome and the shower in the restroom was consistent with heat which is hard to find. The beds in the rooms seemed to be memory foam and were immensely comfortable as well. Would wholeheartedly recommend 10/10!

23762863,474920485,2019-06-23,6312538,Amy,"Kathy’s place had every little detail covered! It was easy to check in, even when our flight was very delayed and we arrived late at night. I forgot my toothbrush and was worried about finding one at that late hour, but of course there was one waiting for me in the bathroom! It showed how much thought she puts in to taking care of guests. Her neighborhood is really safe and I was able to go on runs in the area."
19893591,187787471,2017-08-27,72861034,Stevie,"This was the perfect place for our girls weekend getaway! We had the entire basement apartment to ourselves and rarely heard footsteps above (very light). The rules/guidelines were clear and everything was easy to figure out. Shannon even brought down a can opener since we forgot ours! I really appreciated the fact that they sent a YouTube video of how to find where to park-SUPER helpful! It's a really lovely apartment in a beautiful neighborhood. Great location for easy access to dispensaries, downtown activities and local shopping. We loved everything about our stay and look forward to staying again!"

7931953,277112715,2018-06-15,80758328,Casey,My husband & I loved our stay! We were looking for a place to unwind from our hectic work schedule & see a concert at Red Rocks. The neighborhood is so peaceful & every time we called a Lyft they usually arrived in a two minute span every time. We did not want to rent a car this trip & came out ahead using Lyft. Tonya is a great host and the house felt like home. We would definitely stay again next time we are in town!
2817786,88439063,2016-07-24,79730531,Caroline,She told me the instructions of how to get into the house before she was home for work. The house was beautiful and she was extremely welcoming. She was interested in getting to know me and what I do. 
25309855,366518170,2019-01-02,11138546,Shelby,Michele’s place is amazing! We stayed here for New Years and it was a perfect location for short Uber rides anywhere you could ever need to go. We walked 6 minutes to the mile high stadium and there’s even a little bar/restaurant on the corner. But our top 2 favorite things was the bed linens and Michele’s helpfulness and response time! Would highly recommend!

The hosts offered great feedback on our plans throughout the week and they had a cool dog named Shy that we got to say hi to during the day (seriously one of the happiest dogs we have ever met).  The living area we stayed in was very spacious and had all of the amenities that we could have wanted. Also had a great backyard to relax in after a long day of exploring Colorado. If we end up back in Denver we will be staying here.  Highly recommended!!!

The house was extremely clean with directions for everything you might need to access in the house. They even had snacks available upon arrival which was a really nice touch. My friends and I️ were able to enjoy the patio and really liked the indoor/outdoor speaker system that was available to use. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay at Rob and Nikki’s again!"
13752452,262390106,2018-05-08,178721839,Meg,"I had no idea what I was doing when I booked a home close to downtown Denver.  Wasn't familiar with the area at all.  This place was perfect.  We walked to downtown, the neighborhood itself is adorable, so many places close by to eat or get a drink.  I could not recommend this home enough.  Amazing, perfect place to stay and allowed us to do so many fun things we wouldn't have thought about doing if we were staying somewhere else."

Friends and I went to Denver to get away from Wyoming and party in the city. Perfect location for it. We'll defiently come back"
2957097,30979044,2015-04-30,5099213,Kirsten,"Everything at this home was as advertised. My family felt at home and really enjoyed their stay. The hot tub was great, after long days of hiking.

The pictures accurately described how gorgeous this bungalow is! The backyard is amazing and we enjoyed being able to spend some quality time with a fireplace and games - great memories were made here! If you are traveling with a group, do not hesitate to book here- you won’t regret it! It is clean, cozy, and has an overall great vibe!"

Neighborhood and proximity to everything could be better but for the price can't complain much.  Recommended!"

7359477,52082549,2015-10-26,37403382,Stephani,"In short, this is a very clean and cute house that is centrally located.  Tess was a great host and very responsive.  We never saw her, but she was quick to provide us with the few things we requested.  

My friend and I stayed here from Thurs-Sunday so we would have a central hub in which to explore the city and surrounding areas.  It's a great location, because it's close to a major highway and to cute restaurants/shops.  It's a small place, but it's decorated really cute and perfectly sized for 2 or 3 people.  

I used to live in this area and it's one of those eclectic neighborhoods that has mansions alongside bungalows and apartments.  The stadium and a grocery store are nearby as is a lot of cute shops and restaurants, but the street itself is quiet.  

We will definitely stay again if we come back to Denver.  My only suggestion is to communicate her via phone text after you book.  Sometimes the AirBNB messages didn't get through.  "
21960159,535960927,2019-09-25,33221659,Jose Manuel,"This is a spectacylar living space and I highly, highly recommmend it.  The host was attentive and very responsive.

I will certainly be back."

31051314,483625454,2019-07-07,114504277,Darrell,The Carriage House is in a great location.  The house is well appointed and very clean.  The internet didn't work while we were there but hopefully that gets remedied in the future.  I would stay there again.  The bed and the couch were very comfortable.
19120025,179887196,2017-08-08,18340749,John,"Kelly's place is very nice, new, and clean. This is an ideal place to stay with a small group. She gave really good recommendations especially Crema and Work and Class. The neighborhood seemed to be growing fast and becoming an even better location. "

Right across from Great Divide Brewery, and 10-15 minute walk to pretty much all of the best restaurants/bars in the LoDo and Ballpark neighborhoods. The house manual was very thorough and had complete instructions for all amenities and the check-out process. The Wifi was a little spotty on the upper level (bedroom area) but worked well in the rest of the apartment. Would definitely stay here again!"
32534303,524286409,2019-09-05,136511863,Sophia,Ayman was a great host! He was really friendly and gave us some great recommendations on the Denver outings. The room and entire house was extremely clean and the towels were hotel quality! Definitely affordable and worth it!
9032492,519974148,2019-08-29,12648786,Curt,"Cheryl's place is a perfect spot in the Stapleton area. Located in a quiet neighborhood within a few blocks of several parks including an off leash dog park, it's just a short trip to downtown Denver making it the best of both worlds. I would definitely stay here again or recommend it to friends and family."

19909192,421138373,2019-03-08,245893424,Alina,"Jorge was accommodating and polite, although we had a bit of trouble finding the place. Cleanliness wasn’t exactly on par but if you’re just looking for a place to crash, this is it. Broadhm Apartments IS the correct building if you get confused!"
12963374,407302762,2019-02-01,38800422,Wafiq,Robert's place was perfect for my work trip to Denver. Flights were delayed and I ended up getting in later than expected and my check in process was smooth. Robert sent me all the proper instructions and everything was exactly as described. I didn't run into anyone at the house so I really felt like the only person there. The location was also perfect if you have stuff going on near Coors field. I will certainly be back!

23381316,285394923,2018-07-03,16192862,Jeanette,"Dan was a great host. He provided all the proper instructions on how to check in and out. The space was just as described.  He also rents out another room and the restroom is shared with that room. Both rooms and the restroom are located in the basement. We loved that it a separate entrance from the house, it made it super convenient to go in and out at our own time without disturbing anyone. I would recommend this place and would stay here again."

26688184,310622594,2018-08-19,14343543,Brett,"I stayed at Tom's place for a bachelor party weekend, and it was perfect. When we weren't out exploring the city or taking advantage of the great bars and restaurants in the neighborhood, we enjoyed having such a nice home base to relax and recharge. Tom was an excellent host who was very responsive and accommodating. I would highly recommend his Airbnb to anyone. "

23248670,495937795,2019-07-26,271606056,Zachary,Trace’s place is an amazing getaway. Anything you want to go to in town is less than a $10 Uber ride and even Red Rocks was only $20 (until surge prices kick in for shows.)  Beautiful view of the Mountains and super comfortable place to relax between sight seeing and other planned events. Can’t say enough about the place.
22408497,270902237,2018-05-30,100670825,Hazel,"Lacey and Larry’s place was beautiful and cozy! I would recommend to anyone passing through the area. Fairly close to hikes, downtown , and Whole Foods! In  a cute n trendy neighborhood :)"

They had smart tvs to put our Netflix login in and a really nice deck outside. 

Parking was never an issue, and the neighbor said hello and let me know about street sweeping.

Thanks!

13724407,124770590,2017-01-02,99234976,Evan,Great house! Two very large beds and a great L couch. Very good location especially if you're trying to catch a Broncos game. The backyard is huge and a great place to hangout and grill. 
11789571,105358261,2016-10-01,94843996,Jackie,"Kenny's place was perfect! After traveling most of the week, my boyfriend and I ended our week/weekend in Denver - this place met needs we didn't even realize we would have. The place is spacious and inviting and decorated charmingly. We were close enough for a cheap uber downtown, yet also took advantage of the West Highlands neighborhood and just hung out watching TV with drinks and takeout (picked up from the awesome and convenient neighborhood restaurant/bar/shoppes area one block over).

Not only is it a great location/apartment, Kenny was an awesome host. We were welcomed with a little treat and a detailed manual of house rules/amenities (which were generous), which proved to be very helpful. We even got to meet him briefly on the way out, and he was super nice. Very attentive and friendly but also hands-off enough to let you do your thing which was much appreciated since we'd been all over the place and exhausted upon arrival.

Feel like I'd just be rambling on if I continued writing any more. If you're considering doing so, definitely book this place!"

Took the party bus shuttle from Epic Brewery to Red Rocks and didn't have to drive at all. Pretty much just used the room to sleep, and it worked great for that."

It was a quiet neighborhood with tons of street parking available, but we also felt conveniently located to all parts of the city - We were a 10-minute drive from a concert at the Paramount Theatre. The house was spotless, modern and stylishly decorated. Check-in was painless and communication with Judy was super easy. I would liken our stay to a hotel in the best way possible – Meaning these hosts are pros and have all of the bases covered for their guests. Highly recommend."

21993592,535055770,2019-09-23,23050056,Nancy,"If you want an excellent location in LoDo Denver, this is it.  Centrally located to get everywhere downtown - Union Station, Coors Field, Milk Block, the arts district (all walkable distances) RiNo, LoHi and light rail all a short distance away.  You can also hit the highway too to head to Red Rocks or the mountains.  The unit had all the amenities needed including gated parking, a washer /dryer and kitchen utensils /appliances.   Vince was super responsive to all our questions or needs!  Thank you Vince for a super stay.   We hope to be back."
3217063,204977538,2017-10-20,13758477,Addison,"Andrea's place was easy to get to, clear instructions, decent wifi, and an awesome location. I was able to walk to a great coffee shop about a block away, see a lot of the art galleries in the area, and the commute to downtown was about 5 minutes. Definitely a great bang-for-your-buck stay in Denver"

21796586,234452540,2018-02-12,31313839,Mj,"Alicia & Josh are amazing hosts they went above and beyond. Everything was really really clean and well organized and labeled. The bed in the master was really comfortable and the decor was amazing all together. There was every amenity you could think of available as well. Alicia & Josh were flexible with our check-in time and greeted us with a nice shoveled and salted walkway (Denver snow day yay!)
Overall best place to stay in the area, I will be back to stay again!"
15666157,454174783,2019-05-17,56549764,Andrea,"Erin's home is very special! It is QUIET, very clean, quite comfortable, open and airy, filled with positive energy-and affordable! It is close to all kinds of places: DU, Washington and Harvard Gulch Parks, Old South Pearl Street, the Light Rail. Incredible value! PLUS, Erin is very attentive! I'd HIGHLY recommend staying at Erin's place!"

7663335,75758638,2016-05-22,65807605,Laura,"Our first experience with Airbnb was an excellent one! Our host John couldn't have been better. He was helpful, welcoming, and provided prompt responses to our questions. John's condo was absolutely perfect for us. It is very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. Based on what we wanted to do, the location was excellent! We did an extensive amount of walking! We walked to the Botanic Gardens, Cheeseman Park, Capitol Building, and up and down 16th St. for shopping. The condo is conveniently located across the street from a grocery store, just a few blocks from a gas station, and close to a drug store. There are so many places (restaurants, tourist attractions, stores, etc.) within walking distance, that we only rented a car for part of the time we were there. However, we did appreciate the off-street parking. Between the buses, the A-Line to the airport and back, and the downtown location of the condo, we only rented a car for out-of-town destinations (Red Rocks and Garden of the Gods). The condo is accurately depicted in the pictures. We enjoyed our stay there so much, we definitely plan on returning. Thank you John! You were wonderful!"
15310830,223117741,2017-12-31,151399515,Matthew,Great place to stay. It was clean and comfortable. It was also in walking distance of restaurants and coffee. Definitely check out St. Mark's coffee shop when you are here.
19548421,340360323,2018-10-23,66975770,Taylor,"Stefanis place was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Colorado! It had everything we could have possibly needed. It was in a great location. We traveled a lot and it was within reasonable distance from everywhere we had planned to go. Stefani was a great host, reaching out to make sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking to stay in Denver! Thanks again!"

27267320,511653766,2019-08-17,243331751,Chris,"Jake’s place is stylin. Lovely kitchen, seating on outdoor deck, private bathroom with modern fixtures. Photos and description in listing are spot on.

One thing to be aware of - you do have to walk up three flights of stairs to get to the room, so keep that in mind if you have any physical limitations."
29772590,419733827,2019-03-04,27565292,Annam,"Comfortable, cozy, clean, spacious home with everything we needed. Great location near groceries, a brewery, and beautiful parks. The shower has great water pressure and the bed was very comfortable too. Joey responded quickly to my messages and made check-in and check-out a breeze!"
17329756,151956808,2017-05-14,68564583,Chiara,"This is the most lovely apartment, clean, well- furnished and with comfrotable beds. I must say that the pictures do not make justice of it, and it is actually much nicer than what the pictures suggest. I was there with my family, and the neighborhood was perfect for my 2yo, since we could just step out of the door and play on the sidewalk. 

Christina was a caring host."
15451442,287856774,2018-07-08,57965721,Allison,"Came to town to go to a show at Red Rocks. The location was great at 20 minutes away and the coffee, eggs, and bacon were a plus!"

16026347,148325773,2017-04-30,65408514,Jeff,Tamara and Michaels place was very quaint and had everything we needed. They were very accommodating and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Denver in a cool part of town.

17592456,267733860,2018-05-22,39264545,Courtney,"Brianna and Cory were more than gracious hosts in every sense of the word. They were fun and down to earth people that made me feel at home, and I would definitely recommend their place. On top of them as people, their place was close to downtown Denver, and public amenities and transportation. Their home also had unique touches that added an artistic flare which helped add to its charm."

Then add in decor, fireplace and comfy bed - wonderful!!!   A special place is set up with sink and refrigerator.   Bottled water, coffees and teas fill out the convenient area.  Awesome hosts and the cutest dogs make this the best place to stay!!! "
24249285,512943027,2019-08-18,32131820,Jordan,"Great location to restaurants, bars and just a few blocks from Coors Field.  This is a prime location to enjoy the Denver nightlife and just a 10-12 min walk to downtown shops and mall."

7497461,275195317,2018-06-10,167967450,Delia,"Great value! Great location! Ceiling probably too low for a 6 footer. Never heard any noise/creaky floors from upstairs, comfortable bed, good temperature even though it was 95 degrees outside!
Forest Room 5, Prosper Oats & Little Man ice cream best local spots. 
Breweries: Wynkoop, Falling Rock, Tap 14, Epic.
Lugden Storage: guy in a van will store your bags for $10 on 16th by Union Station. It’s legit."

13414484,138674188,2017-03-20,65056368,Kalob,"Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Cal, Dave was very helpful and made our time in Denver better than we could have ever hoped. Both are great at communication, accommodating the guests, and respect privacy. 

We loved Colorado, especially Denver, and we will be back soon. Hopefully, we can stay here again."

33160278,552443817,2019-10-21,109646900,Shawna,"This place was the best place I could have possibly stayed at for my visit to Denver!! The house is so chill along with the owners! A quick ride to downtown and access to all things, and parking was a breeze if you have a car! I can’t wait to come back and stay here again. 10/10 recommend!"

30955430,483695005,2019-07-07,12237636,Caty,By far the best house I have ever stayed in. Clean & beautiful and Hank was amazing with communication!!!
22770241,416568251,2019-02-24,72296654,Alex,"Great space, really enjoyed my time there. Neighborhood is quiet but close to downtown area. And there are tons of cool cafes/restaurants within walking distance. Would recommend!"
19501629,468980846,2019-06-13,129768401,Isaac,Sarah was a great host. Followed up in a timely manner. We broke a clothes hanger and she did not make a big deal about it. Great stay overall
17155851,196319974,2017-09-22,48450673,Michael,"We enjoyed our stay in Denver and loved Mark's neighborhood. Cons: The property is smaller than it looks in pictures. The wifi is slow and spotty. Since the TV has no cable nor antenna AND the wifi is too slow to even chromecast Netflix, you won't be able to watch anything on TV - it's purely for decoration. All that said, the property served our needs and we loved using the courtyard and grill."
24179534,476616265,2019-06-26,46741451,Josh,"You would be hard pressed to find a better AirBNB in the downtown Denver area for one or two people.  The owner had it sparkling clean, the check-in and out was a breeze with front desk staff who were very helpful and quick.   This place is literally next door to the pickup area that has a free bus route that loops right through downtown and back.  But there are plenty of restaurants and things to do within a short walk. Easy access to the pool and workout facility next door.  Highly recommend!"
17498473,142508001,2017-04-08,6655959,Emily,Our stay at Rafer's was just what we needed. Description is accurate and we enjoyed the eggs and bagels and coffee in the fridge. It truly is 2 blocks from the light rail. 
6866385,82533727,2016-06-28,20869585,Norbert," Paul is a natural host! He made me feel so comfortable that I sort of forgot that I was in someone else's home and staying in someone else's guest bedroom.  Paul went above and beyond and making me feel comfortable and is if I was a family member.  He was truly amazing and it was a perfect connection for me to have made as I transitioned into a seven day silent meditation retreat there in Colorado.  My experience couldn't have been any better. Perfect in every!!!   So grateful to you, Paul. You are a one-of-a-kind human being!  "
8739814,243089239,2018-03-14,64199916,Jonathan,Erik's place is within walking distance too many different places. Would stay again!

9110380,164202754,2017-06-26,27261159,Staci,"Gina's house is in an excellent location, and was especially convenient for us!  Just a 5 minute drive to downtown.  Communication was excellent, and we had no issues whatsoever checking in, finding our room, finding the parking permit, using the wifi, etc.  The stay was smooth as could be!  The house was very clean and comfortable.  We didn't see Gina much, as we were gone most of our stay, but she was very warm and welcoming when we did see her.  Great place!  I would definitely stay here again!"
4427385,491794077,2019-07-20,176881543,Laura,"Our family enjoyed this superior clean, updated and conveniently located condo! This area felt extremely safe and quiet. Natalie is a superior host. We would definitely return to Denver and stay here again!"

24083668,482527470,2019-07-06,158264305,Jason,Such an amazing place! Ten minutes from down town and even closer to amazing hole in the wall places!

35578815,490482662,2019-07-18,207423613,Morgan,"This place worked out great for our family of 4. There was plenty of space and it was less than a 10 minute drive from downtown Denver. There was also a park pretty close by we drove the kids to so they could play. We went to Elitch Garden's for the day and it took about 10 mins to get there, even in the morning commuter traffic."
6185753,276078862,2018-06-12,28657572,Laura,"This was the perfect little space for a quick trip to Denver. My husband and I enjoyed walking to nearby coffee and sandwich shops, and were a quick Uber/Lyft drive away from other amenities. This place was clean, quiet and more than enough space for the two of us! Would definitely recommend this space. "
16598808,556121476,2019-10-28,303503512,Richard,"Very nice, clean place. We took a short walk to Larimar Street and had a terrific afternoon visiting breweries, a distillery, and a winery. Lots of young people having a fun time and a variety of food options. Matt was a great host and would respond to emails within minutes. 
Would definitely recommend this property."

866145,207689737,2017-10-29,14887875,Katelynn,"We were out and about for most of our visit, but Preston's home was a fantastic base for a day of exploring Denver. His home is beauty decorated and the bed is really comfortable. We had a great stay and I'd highly recommend Preston's place."
15802763,175016529,2017-07-27,141044612,Christopher,"Great location, clean, accessible and the owners prepared us well for the visit.  I highly recommend this home, we had a fantastic experience!"

7247567,272605538,2018-06-03,123486713,Taynah,Beautiful and cozy place close to many parks. 
7899712,78314606,2016-06-06,3702715,Phillip,"Both Dan and his girlfriend were very nice, gracious, and did their absolute best to make us fee comfortable. The room we stayed in was very nice, with two beds that were fine. That said, the house was not walking distance to pretty much anywhere, the house itself was a bit rundown, and it reminded me very much of my apartment when I was a starving college student. If you're looking for luxury, this isn't the place. But if you're young and don't mind the mess, it's just fine. One downside was that there was no A/C and we needed it at nighttime. It was hot and sweaty and difficult to sleep due to the heat. "
774712,336682638,2018-10-14,20128433,Karen,"Great city location in a cool, relaxed neighborhood. Lots of dining options and proximity to Cheeseman Park was super convenient. Place was clean and organized and comfortable for one person. The bathroom is really small, but the kitchen and living room area was just what I needed for my month's stay."
14027297,143606072,2017-04-12,81349946,Mike,"Caroline's listing was a gem! So close to public transit that takes you downtown and to the airport with ease. She supplied two bikes for our use which was unexpected and amazing. We were able to check out the farther parts of town without needing a car. The bed is a godsend, with memory foam to really sink into after a long day of hiking. The listing itself is in a cute neighborhood with lots of coffee shops nearby. There are K-Cups but no Keurig  in the apartment, however a drip coffee maker is available, which makes for some craft coffee in the comfort of your home. Overall the stay was comfortable and I would be glad to stay again."
15583685,190989570,2017-09-05,12773770,Alex,Close to everything and exactly as described. Would stay again.
13153127,85130452,2016-07-10,52695634,Pamela,Alex went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  Nice house and great location.  We'd be happy to stay here again!
3412478,196580421,2017-09-23,142865548,Tantan,"Hostess of the year! Brandy has a super cool, super clean house. This gal is a neat freak! She changes the bathroom hand towels more than I do! Perfect location for accessing all the cool Denver attractions.  Beautiful nightime view. The backyard has flowers, vegetable garden and chickens- perfect for sitting outside and enjoying the great Denver weather. And we had fresh eggs! Over the top.  The house felt so comfortable and we just felt like we were home.  Loved, loved, loved this place and all that came with it. Will definitely stay here again and will advise all going to Denver  to stay at Brandy's!"
14824298,109960785,2016-10-23,18893240,Kami,This was a great place to stay! Everything was perfect and just as described. We are from Denver but needed a bigger place to stay when our family came to visit. We want to stay here every time they come to town!

21120569,548028560,2019-10-16,53628120,Laura,"Great AirBnB! Very comfortable bed and pillows, and very clean. Really loved the big windows overlooking the yard/garden. If you have a rolling suitcase, be aware that the entryway to the door is a loose stone path and so you may need to be able to carry your rolling suitcase 20-30 feet or it may slip into the rocks and not roll well. Really enjoyed how close this place was to so many things!"
27425457,448936727,2019-05-05,83130113,Vanessa,"Willow’s place was very quaint and had a lovely backyard.  The beds were comfortable and everything was provided to make our stay fun and relaxing. I would suggest for future renters that they rent a car as hiking, restaurants etc are quite far away/really long walks. Thanks again Willow!"
16476273,281325859,2018-06-24,32229716,Aaron,"I just needed a place to sleep for the night during my stay in Denver.  The place is exactly how Erika's portrays it.  She allowed me access to the kitchen but I never used it since I was only in the house to sleep and bath.  There were other guests in the house, but one could have never tell based off of how quiet everything was."
28742074,408560286,2019-02-04,166430143,Josh,"Great, would stay again"
9471950,138675435,2017-03-20,77615708,Michelle,"I loved my stay in Denver! The place is in a good location, easy walk to downtown and all the cool things Denver has to offer! Celia is a great host and made everything so easy. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone! "
12128272,281830436,2018-06-25,192873245,Dylan,Stephanie went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable in a new city. She even drove us into town so I could buy some new things after the airline lost my luggage. The carriage house is very homey and clean. If we come back to Denver we will be staying here again! 
22336069,270612516,2018-05-29,84161556,Hannah,Great location- walking distance to a ton of breweries and coffeeshops but in a quiet neighborhood.

6348993,226595437,2018-01-11,16647218,Yaniv,"I am an Airbnb host in Las Vegas and familiar with the process of accommodating hundreds of individuals from all around the world. With that said, Matt and Vicki went above and beyond my expectations in their hospitality. It was the first time my girlfriend and I stayed in Denver and needed numerous help with places to eat and they were quick to respond with great recommendations. 

If we ever go back to Denver, my girlfriend and I have already decided this is the best value available."
33320394,455409467,2019-05-19,78467904,Brandon,Everything about this place was accurate and pretty great. Would highly recommend.
20902989,452655777,2019-05-13,242599693,Werner,"This is a very comfortable Airbnb site with lots of options to reduce costs of meals with the well-equipped kitchen. The Master suite is comfortable with ample space to spread out and get comfortable. A comfortable side chair would have been a nice addition. (My husband has a bad hip, and sitting on the bed all the time wasn't the most comfortable seating option for him.) The walk to the light rail is just over two blocks away, which is convenient, but if you're a light sleeper, note that train whistles are also just blocks away too. Overall, we enjoyed this townhouse. I'm glad that our first Airbnb experience was so positive."

Thank you."
2822651,205020376,2017-10-20,29952121,Nadia,"Ian’s place is indeed cozy and convenient, as well as clean and comfortable. Communication and check in were smooth, the beds great, the kitchen well stocked for cooking. The location close to shops, restaurants, and the Cherry Creek Trail are big bonuses. I didn’t meet Ian but he was easy to reach & helpful. I’d stay here again next time I’m in Denver."
17556772,414136728,2019-02-18,169379621,Matt,"The hosts were welcoming and accommodating to our needs. The apartment itself was a pleasant surprise- clean, spacious, and homey. They offered use of the entire apartment to make our stay most comfortable, including a kitchen that was fully supplied with cooking appliances. I would recommend this to any future guests!"
25477072,447494647,2019-05-03,257593208,Bill,"Quiet, clean and a great choice for singles or couples to stay over on business or holiday."
17303217,309736283,2018-08-18,16927706,Stacey,"Stevens place exceeded all of my expectations! I made a special request and he immediately agreed and communicated to ensure that my needs were met. When I arrived the place was exactly as pictured but better. Super clean, very well stocked with helpful and necessary items (fresh eggs!!), and I found that he went above and beyond my special request to make sure I was comfortable. The only tiny negative I can think of is the noise from the street(when you are outside enjoying the yard) which gets slightly busy during peak traffic times, but for the location it is worth it. Cant wait to go back!"
14369542,453731310,2019-05-16,65412603,Cameron,"Fantastic value, a nice quiet neighborhood but still easy to get downtown. Highly recommend if you're looking to be near the airport"

Nice apartment, clean and with all necessary stuff. 
just one thing bother me is that lots of car noises at early morning which affects my sleep.  I am light sleep."
16807778,137335844,2017-03-14,14207397,Jessica,"My hubby and I were super pleased with Jonny and Micayla's home. It was so beautiful and clean. Check in was a breeze, our stay was amazing and everything went very smoothly. I only met Johnny since we got there pretty late but he was very friendly and welcoming.

19848263,343762441,2018-11-01,15481522,Karl,"Was in Denver for a working visit so I was only here to sleep/shower but the neighborhood was pleasant, walkable and had good options for food and drink.  Peaceful 10 minute walk to the rapid transit.  Spotless clean, and a nice view to boot.  Would definitely stay again."

They are very quick to respond and super sweet. Their place is conveniently located close to the airport but in a very quiet neighborhood. Our room was spotless, cozy, and perfect for a couple. They had ample amenities and greeted us with a cup of hot coffee in the morning! It was nice chatting with Dan and meeting their sweet pets. We'd love to stay here again. Thank you!"
14369542,194043458,2017-09-15,50466299,Lauren,"Even though we didn't get to actually meet Jenn and Jay, they were wonderful hosts! Communicated well all of the important details. Their place was clean, comfortable, convenient to the airport, and actually bigger than we expected! They had a bunch of amenities that we were very grateful for after traveling. Snacks, coffee, hairdryer, clean soft towels, and a quiet place to rest our heads between travel. Thanks again for starting off our trip right!"
9108143,291866763,2018-07-16,58513819,Chris,"Unit as described and is lovely. Wifi works great. Beds comfortable. Really enjoyed the stay. Just slightly more tedious check-out requirements than the typical Airbnb I’ve stayed in, but not too onerous. Would recommend."
14932614,177750568,2017-08-03,34197638,Kristin,"An Airbnb that actually has the second B!  Surprised and thankful for the inclusion of breakfast.  Eggs, milk, coffee, cereal and more!  Place was also nice and clean. Convenient to downtown with many ways to avoid freeway traffic. Also close to a park with a lake for morning walks."
26605718,336835017,2018-10-14,7387186,Alisa And Terry,Nice quiet neighborhood.  Easy access to interstates.  The place was nice and warm through our snow stay.  Christine was very quick to reply when sending messages.   We would stay there again.

& the pictures she has posted of the Airbnb are accurate but do not show how perfect and stunning her Airbnb is!!"
19437073,255199801,2018-04-19,108202795,Gregory,Great host. The condo is better in person. Love the big TVs
26010149,526871509,2019-09-09,44121510,Sarah,"If you're looking for an overnight stay near the airport, Monica and John's home is hard to beat. It's also exceptionally clean, check-in was smooth, and they were quick to respond. They have a ton of amenities and have thought of everything. We had a rental car which made transportation to and from the airport easy, but it's about a $20 dollar ride (depending on the time) to call a car."
6488535,282954080,2018-06-28,122523001,Diana,"We had a great one night stay. Great location, great price, amazing communication, fantastic space. Only negative was it was very hot during our stay and it is an older building so cooling off was a bit difficult. But it didn't take anything away for us."

PS the speakers are AMAZING"
32470069,452265095,2019-05-12,27613898,Tristan,"Musa's place is a great way to experience Denver! As per the description, you won't be dissapointed by the arrangements throughout the house, matching exactly the pictures and description of the listing.
Musa is always present yet discrete and super friendly and open to share tips about the area.
The house is located within walking distance of the amazing RiNo area and 15-20 minutes walking to the city centre.
I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely chose Musa's home again should I stay in Denver. Thank you for the great hospitality Musa!"

Some of our favorite things about the carriage house: The bed and couches were incredibly comfortable, we had more than enough towels and linens available, all sorts of lamps and power strips so we could easily charge phones, cameras, etc. Kitchen had everything you might need! Also, we really loved having the designated parking spot/gated driveway. 
Also, it's in a great little neighborhood of restaurants and shops! 

Overall, you can just tell that Andrea has put a lot of thought and effort into making the house so cozy and perfect. It felt like a home away from home!"
16742127,466796285,2019-06-09,184147495,Soleil,"Nice , clean , comfortable and convenient. If you have questions, they answer right away. Cute apartment with everything you need. So much nicer than a hotel. Situated in a beautiful neighborhood."
15116690,261041878,2018-05-05,175523186,Isis,"If you’re looking to rent somewhere in Denver, this place is a MUST. Me and my boyfriend stayed for a few days for our anniversary and it was amazing.
Everything went extremely smoothly and Danelle even provided some toiletries, smoking accessories, and more! I would not hesitate to Stark here again. Thank you for everything Danelle!"

He even had a CrossFit gym that my husband worked out in steps from our door.  The grounds were beautiful too!  We can’t wait to explore this and his other places!  We also love that he grew up nearby and knows the history of the neighborhood."
12169927,127244103,2017-01-16,34578167,Caterina,Gabriel and Vanessa's cozy apartment was perfect for my long weekend stay. The location was perfect and near a ton of restaurants and shops.  They were very accommodating with check-in and check-out and left a list of things to do around the city which was very helpful.  I would recommend anyone stay at their apartment.
14360548,315038635,2018-08-27,56563047,Chelsie,I loved this cozy gem. It offered everything the recreational traveler needs while being right near downtown Denver and about 30 minutes to amazing mountain views.      
10061459,80045858,2016-06-15,72016229,Eddy,Coming in from out of state sometimes you don't know what to expect. Emily and Steve  are good people and were helpful in a lot of ways . I would stay there again

21069616,235144612,2018-02-15,114572537,John,"This spacious, immaculately clean, light-filled apartment was perfect for our 3-day visit with family in Denver.  It has great views of the busy, growing city out of large windows and from the little balcony.  The layout offers both privacy and shared activity space for a group or family.  Furnishings are comfy and the kitchen well-equipped (not a single implement we needed was missing--this is rare).  And there's foosball, which we all got into.  The location was excellent for us--near our young adult children in the Lower Downtown area, with great restaurants, walking adventures, things to see and do, public transportation, groceries nearby.  The hosts were readily accessible and very helpful.  A great experience!"

The Bungalow was a great place to rest after a day adventuring around the city or even just enjoying a relaxing morning with coffee while listening to the light songs of birds and windchimes.

Highly recommend!"
37244418,547238672,2019-10-14,26112375,Jeffrey,"Great location and stylish space with great amenities.  Union station is a block away, with direct service to the airport.

Within several blocks are your choice of eating places from ""fine"" to ""casual""  as well as coffee houses.  We would stay there again."

The space is separated from the rest of the house and has everything a  guest could need for business or a vacation visit. The loft feels very private and includes a coffee machine, great shower, comfortable space to relax with a TV, a refrigerator and microwave for your leftovers, dedicated HVAC and great wifi. convenient location to the light rail station and RINO with bars, restaurants, rock climbing gyms and whatever else you could imagine.

23090889,278315081,2018-06-17,52409137,Kiara,Our first AirBnB experience and it was great! Kari’s was a home away from home great place to stay. It was clean and well stocked! Really close to everything 
21684842,450572554,2019-05-09,234415066,Ben,"Easily the simplest experience I’ve had with AirBnB. Great private space, super simple and easy access."
32982805,445635686,2019-04-29,87223719,Michael,"The best part of our stay was the set of instructions and information contained therein sent to us about a week in advance. Every Airbnb host could take a lesson from the quality, utility and content of the information. 

The unit is literally two bedrooms and a small bathroom locked off from the house of which it is a part (with a separate gate-accessed interest. There is no kitchen (or, even, a kitchenette). There is an electric tea kettle, a microwave and a small (hotel-like) refrigerator. To this host’s credit, there were 7 beers in the fridge. There is one closet for both rooms, and it also contains all the unit’s extra sheets, towels and paper supplies (and vacuum and other spare parts). Apparently, the couch in one of the rooms is a fold-out. We did not test it. 

There was shampoo and liquid bath wash, plentiful towels (but no bath mat), paper towels and TP. And, the Wi-Fi worked. 

We had to ask for a drinking glass and a coffee cup (else what could we use the tea kettle for?), and the host, whom we met, accommodated that. 

That was it for the amenities. There was no TV, no snacks, no coffee to be made, nothing. 

The bed was comfy enough. 

Value for price and expectations — middling. I cannot for the life of me imagine 6 people - related or not - staying in the unit and organizing bathroom time. 

Our son and daughter-in-law live about six blocks away. Next visit, we’ll find a different place. 

Lastly, despite the host’s inclusion/recommendation in the info packet, the coffee at Amethyst (nearby) was, at best, mediocre, they gave me a hard time for asking for a go-cup, and they charge full price for refills. I would never go back there.

On the whole, maybe 3 ⭐️ out of 5."
18501879,490499711,2019-07-18,276372216,Paulina,The property was well kept and it had a nice private entrance. The location is great. Kara was wonderful to deal with.
29488638,401728669,2019-01-15,16432039,Kathleen,"Lynn's flat is a perfect base for enjoying the peace and quiet outside the city and yet be close to the E Train into the center of Denver.  Within a short walk are all the fun eateries on S Pearl Street. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and all the amenities from the luxurious bath towels to the well equipped kitchen made our stay perfect. It was our first visit to Denver, and knowing what great place it is and that there is a wonderful flat to rent, we hope to return one day."
16601681,136135689,2017-03-08,28689388,Wesley,"We were on a four-night stay in Denver, visiting a family member in long-term nursing care.  Due to the length of the stay, we needed a comfortable accommodation at a budget rate. Sara's basement dwelling provided that for us nicely.  

Sara was welcoming, friendly and helpful.  The location is safe for your car and a walkable, distinctive neighborhood.  The Richtofen Mansion and carriage house are up the street to the right as you go out the front door.  A couple blocks west is a lovely park with a restored building which was once part of the Richtofen grounds.  The park now serves as a playground and civic center.  The surrounding blocks have distinctive architecture, some creative home designs. The rental is within easy driving distance of the Lowry shopping complex.  

Bedding was comfortable and new, and the basement living space was a bit tight but comfortable.  There is no desk for laptop use, and also no TV.  Internet is fine, the username and password are located on your booking confirmation. We used the kitchen for refrigerator storage and making coffee on Sara's Keurig.

Tradeoffs for a bargain rate:  a very small shower! Lack of natural light in the main room, except for a basement window well. A bit noisy from the house furnace located in an adjacent room.  This would not be a problem in warmer weather.

All in all, this is a good choice if you need budget accommodations ($49 for our visit), a friendly host, a very nice neighborhood."
17325994,269707867,2018-05-27,139668018,Olyvia,"Keith's place was absolutely wonderful! My husband and I felt right at home. It was very clean and organized and there was more than enough space. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet, perfect if you're looking for a ""small corner of the world"". Check in and out was made very easy and convenient and the home is a good distance from downtown. 20/10 would recommend. If we ever come back to denver, Keith's place would be #1 on my list of places to stay."

28078819,422167338,2019-03-10,35162304,Candace,"This place was a dream! It was a perfect location, it came with some nice “gifts” upon entry, and it was clean as a whistle! Everything was updated and the furniture was soooo comfortable. I’ll definitely be staying again and will suggest to my friends. Thankyou so much for making our stay so memorable!"
29132612,425686443,2019-03-18,123431076,Ruben,A chill place to stay and a pretty relaxed neighborhood.  I came in on a day that a blizzard hit and we were able to communicate easily and allowed me to come in earlier than expected.
7859145,491727947,2019-07-20,74205780,Larry & Doni,"This was a really nice visit.  Jennifer was so hospitable and lives in a really fun neighborhood. I was two blocks away from a nice golf course. Great little quaint coffee shops are within walking distance. Jennifer also owns a great restaurant. Make sure you order the breakfast burrito!!  Thanks Jennifer, for being such a great host!!"
9731001,474076061,2019-06-22,236436872,Keana,"It was perfect for my stay. Hosts are veey friendly. They do have cats! I wouldn’t mind, but I am allergic. Everything was very clean, and they were bery helpful with my schedule and let me stay a little later than check-out time."
3917345,152291034,2017-05-15,51089967,Christian,"Nice and comfy home in a somewhat industrial neighborhood. The movement climbing and fitness gym is just really close, one of the best climbing gyms I've ever been at. "

22387134,306416751,2018-08-12,168990785,Erik,"My wife and I stayed here with a couple of close friends for a birthday celebration in Denver. Derek was super helpful and friendly, and he always responded within minutes if we had questions. His place is clean, modern, and well-kept. I really appreciated the low-key but stylish decor, and the space is the perfect size for a group of four. Most everything you might want to see or do downtown is within walking distance, so the location is fantastic, as well. A few things to keep in mind: The bed upstairs is great, but the fold-down couch is on the small side and realistically can only sleep one person comfortably. There is an air mattress, but it, too, is shorter than average. If you have tall friends, they'll probably be more comfortable upstairs. Also, the space is quite literally across the street from Coors Field, so if you'll be staying on a weekend in particular just be aware that some noise goes with the territory. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely stay here again."
23089900,517727968,2019-08-25,3895683,Andy,The house is very clean and well maintained. AC and fans keep the house cool and ventilated. Check in was painless as well.

12990793,103489377,2016-09-22,81252591,Mike,"Pat was just fine.  She had a bum arm with Doctors appointment to go to  and we were going to ball game shortly after arrival, so we did have chance to visit much. The next day we left early for Rocky Mnt Nat'l Park and returned late.  We are pretty familiar with the area so didn't need directions or info from her.  All worked out fine. "
9250245,540480289,2019-10-03,103848711,Karsyn,"This loft is truly amazing! Walking distance to many of the breweries, Larimer Square, concert venues, etc. I will definitely be staying here again."
7912052,125400628,2017-01-05,95762896,Leo,"Aki and his wife were very gracious hosts! They were very hospitable and helpful, and offered us light snacks and breakfast, as well very clean bathrooms and bedrooms, and even went as far as to clean the snow off of our car! It felt like a hotel stay for us, and we would pick this home over any real hotel any day!"
27455846,568736449,2019-11-24,160344383,Jessica,Super fun home. Extremely clean. Very quiet neighborhood. There is a great coffee shop walking distance from the home and everything else is a quick Uber or Lyft ride away!
18950106,246637179,2018-03-25,80238570,Marivi,Gladys' house was perfect.  Easy access to downtown and walking distance to several restaurants and breweries.

38325627,538493164,2019-09-29,115230535,Nicole,This place was the best place I have ever stayed and I travel frequently for work. Mandy’s quick responses and suggestions and hospitality made my trip so much better. Her cute little place provided just what I needed. The backyard is just as cute as the rest of the house.

21782254,459801274,2019-05-27,153274247,Jessica,"This apartment was perfect for our 4 night stay in Denver! We had a rental car and were easily able to park right on the quiet street and venture out to Boulder, Colorado Springs, etc.  We were also able to walk almost everywhere that we went in the city...Coors Field, 16th Street Mall, a couple of museums, restaurants, etc.  We really enjoyed being in a quiet, residential neighborhood with quick & easy access to most everything.

Our favorite things about the apartment itself were the kitchen as we were able to grocery shop and have some meals in, the cute little outdoor patio and the water pressure in the shower was amazing!! It was spotless with unique furnishings and we really couldn't have asked for anything more.  There were snacks, water and even sunscreen when we needed it for a baseball game.  The size and bedroom being downstairs made it really feel like an apartments vs. a hotel room.  Paula was a great host who responded very quickly during booking and was very kind when we briefly met while we were there.  We would highly recommended it to anyone visiting the Denver area and we hope to make it back again someday!"
19503543,281835447,2018-06-25,163623872,Janelle,Love this place and love the host. Was my first time using air bnb and I couldn't be happier! Amazing home! Thank you for everything!!

The breakfasts were outstanding, including thoughtfully working with food allergies and providing amazing celebratory birthday doughnuts! 

These guys are experienced travelers and hosts, and are able to provide nice recommendations. They are right next to some good eats and a B-Share bike station, which made things quite convenient. 

Thanks again!"
21024898,327423471,2018-09-23,1586101,Norm,Great apartment in a great location that’s convenient to many attractions in Denver.  I enjoyed the stay and would book again.
16115411,328588479,2018-09-26,208272099,Keian,"This place is one of the best valued Air BnBs in the Denver Area in my opinion. I looked all over for a good place go have a low key bachelor party and couldn’t have found a better place. Joe (the owner) was very responsive to all messages, always answered my questions directly and concisely, was very helpful in all manners. The house was very clean, spacious, cozy, and an easy place to entertain a group of people. It has very easy (less than 10 minutes) access to the heart of Denver’s night life, yet the house itself is on the West side of 25 and on a very quiet street (seriously, I had my windows open at night and had nothing but pleasant background sounds all night). Highly recommend."
5433111,212601404,2017-11-18,71647533,Sydne,"The unit is in a prime location! Everything we needed was there, safe parking right outside the front door, and we were able to walk to the park and some great restaurants. We definitely look forward to future stays here!"
732845,158148382,2017-06-05,61391550,Ariel,"This place was great for my friends and I. We were in Denver for a few days and everything was relativity close. It was the perfect jump point for some activities outside port Denver such as the Coors brewery and going to rocky mountain national park. 
 The house was in great shape with plenty of room to spread out. The rooftop deck was great place to relax after a long day of white water rafting and shooting. My friends and I would definitely come back and stay here again. "

81540,46264664,2015-09-09,31792443,Cody,Enjoyed staying in a residential area rather than in a big hotel or something. The location was close enough to everything without being in the cluttered downtown area. Favorite food nearby was Beau Jo's pizza.

I found everything I needed in the kitchen. Overall I would recommend this space to a solo traveler or a younger couple looking for a good quiet place to stay in Denver."
21684780,402827511,2019-01-19,3449038,Alison,"We loved staying at Patrick's home.  I was there for almost three weeks with a roommate and we each had plenty of space, we had an easy walk to work downtown, we were close to friends in many other neighborhoods, and we loved all of the beautiful common space with the big living room, dining room, and kitchen.  The only regret is that we weren't there in the summer to take advantage of the huge yard too!"
22379059,519046829,2019-08-27,264828691,Duston,"Kathryn’s place was everything we needed and more.  She put nice and thoughtful touches through out the house including shampoos, conditioners, body wash, q tips, lotion, cotton face pads, dish soap, snacks, coffee with all the fixings, and a fully equip kitchen.  The location is perfect and not far from anything. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance along with grocery stores and parks. If we come back to Denver I would without a doubt stay here again."

Not that far to some cute neighborhoods to walk around. The place was the perfect size for five people. We definitely had enough room, and the backyard was our favorite part of the place! Highly recommend if you don’t want to stay in the Denver city limits."

Not only that but David responded promptly and made sure everything was perfect. This is a great location for anyone since it is minutes away from the heart of Denver."
24397538,455434170,2019-05-19,43530133,Sara,"John’s studio was the perfect spot for my husband and I to stay on our weekend trip to Denver. The location could not be better. We were able to take the train or walk everywhere we wanted to go. Safe neighborhood and great parks, grocery store, and restaurants all within minutes. The studio was exactly as pictured and perfectly kept. The building was trendy and full of amenities including an impressive gym. John was easy to get in touch with, although no problems arose during our stay. We would definitely recommend it!"
24016932,527808174,2019-09-11,272539429,Julie,The house was as advertised. It was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. We had 5 people staying and there was plenty of room to fit all of us. We arrived on Saturday and had no internet until Sunday night. Kyndi was very responsive and took care of the issue. She gave us a refund for the inconvenience. The house is located in an up and coming neighborhood and was close to great shopping and restaurants.  Thanks for a great first Airbnb experience!
15282172,164827542,2017-06-29,11843331,Marc,Emily's place was great.  Location is central in Denver so was easy to get everywhere.  Is also right next to City Park which is an awesome place with a zoo and museum and walking distance to some really good restaurants.  The apartment was more than enough space for my wife and I.  Everything was clean and we even saw Emily and her husband a few times and they were very hospitable.  6 stars!!
14027297,114910419,2016-11-20,97290346,Isabella,Caroline's place was a great home base for a weekend in Denver. There is no TV but we spent most of our time out and about. The bed was extremely comfortable if you like a softer mattress.

25477727,436240710,2019-04-12,37840543,David,"The location is amazing: lots of great restaurants and bars nearby, short walk to the convention center, and a shorter walk to the train station, which I highly recommend for getting to the airport.

The building is quiet, which was great for restful nights. The master bedroom is large and spacious and even though the second room is small, it's also dark and quiet and I enjoyed that.

The unit has a fully stocked kitchen with a small pot, large pot, about 3 or 4 frying pans, and Costco sized salt, pepper, and olive oil. There's even a few spices available, definitely checkout the kitchen before walking over to Whole Foods, which is only a 10 minute walk."
15281688,168065470,2017-07-08,90140973,Stacey,"Mary Ann's place was great!! Much bigger and more private than I had anticipated! Mary Ann, John, Apollo and Ella (their beautiful, well mannered furry friends) greeted me upon arrival and answered any questions I had for them. Interaction with them outside of check-in was minimal as I was in town for a wedding. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone looking for a private, cozy place! Thanks again!! :)"

We only stayed one night, but wished we could have stayed longer to spend more time with the wonderful host and her adorable dogs in her lovely home."
18950106,502449487,2019-08-04,6501675,Lindsey,Cute neighborhood and very convenient to town and restaurants art walk etc. had plenty of space and even a cute yard to enjoy out back. Coming from the land of central AC being commonplace and being very pregnant it was a little hard to get the place feeling cool. Granted it was exceptionally hot during our visit. Would recommend staying here for a fun Denver getaway.
19844469,323458304,2018-09-15,15813504,Matthew,"Mckenzie is super responsive and has a cute, conveniently located, 1 bedroom. I would stay here again and I would choose Mckenzie as a host again."

The location is walkable to many of the downtown Denver attractions. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone in search of a place to stay in the city!"
17175148,310686844,2018-08-19,171774568,Kusha,"We stayed here for two nights-- Lovely house!   Supe clean, great location and parking.  Definitely would stay here again.  "
9080234,160357831,2017-06-13,47740507,Owen & Madrone,"We were in Denver to attend our sons's graduation from University of Denver and Katie and Tyler's place could not have been more perfect! Walking distance to the campus, wonderful front porch and patio spaces to enjoy our meals and conversation, and even a bedroom for our 5 month old granddaughter! We had an amazing visit and am sure anyone who stays here will love it."
16589595,556530841,2019-10-29,36823158,Aditi,Perfect place to stay especially if you need to catch an early flight. Clean space and polite hosts. Check in and out was a breeze. Loved the clean bed and bath space.
834896,39760766,2015-07-26,32354050,Sigrid,"We really enjoyed our stay and loved the location. I was in for my high school reunion and all of the events were near by. The cottage is very nice and was equipped with everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom and shower were nice. The only disappointing thing was the second bed as it was a pull out sofa or a blow up mattress in the living (Website hidden by Airbnb) we misunderstood, but we were expecting two bedrooms. Nan the owner is lovely. We would definitely recommend, but it is only one bedroom."
26500661,419787992,2019-03-04,125056341,Amy,"This was the perfect place to stay for a solo traveler like me! Street parking in front of the house was never an issue. Conveniently located near Larimer street which is great for taking a walk to view the murals and eat at nearby restaurants. The king bed was also soo comfy, I had a hard time getting out of it! Didn’t get to meet Allison but they were kind enough to shovel a clean path through the snow that accumulated the night of my arrival - much appreciated! Overall a great experience, would def stay there again."
18275427,273049144,2018-06-04,35661896,Angela,"Loved this charming cottage in a very central location. Quiet neighborhood and near good places to eat and easy to get downtown. Very responsive hosts.  The garden is a wonderful addition!  The bed is very comfortable. As shown in the pictures, it is small but fine for 2 people. Even so, be prepared that the bathroom is very small. Two people cannot be in there at the same time.  However, I would not let that be a hindrance to staying there. It was a great stay!"
13066317,109701303,2016-10-23,19129326,Megan,Matt left great directions and was very welcoming to his home.  The home had plenty of amenities and the space was charming and clean.   
32902010,495909916,2019-07-26,187340738,Sean,"HEADS UP!!!!
So my girlfriend and I booked 2 nights at this place and the bedroom wasn’t vacuumed the sheets had bleach stains. That’s the best part about it. So the reviews talk about the ac being broken. It’s not he just doesn’t use it.  The bathroom was DISGUSTING. I’m not talking about items here and there. I mean mildew all in the shower mold all over the shower curtains. SHOWER SHOES ARE A MUST!! We didn’t even go in the rest of the house. There were chunks of hair water sitting in the bath tub forming that brown line. And if your scared of spiders or bugs don’t even bother staying here."
11692342,281871175,2018-06-25,54797410,Hunmin,"very clean and nice location, quick response as well."
33291530,546473937,2019-10-13,118754254,Liz,"Came out to Denver with a friend to go to a show at Red Rocks. Had a great time, the place was cozy although we were not there for very long even throughout the day. The beds are pretty comfy too. Nick is a great host & plenty of amenities at the townhome. Parking is great & the neighborhood is lovely. It’s pretty close to RiNo district which is an amazing area to check out & be in!"

6333040,127238966,2017-01-16,5138904,Kasadey,"Cozy, spacious space that is absolutely adorable. Amazing lighting. Staying at this carriage house is way better than a hotel... really you should just book it already! You'll be sad if you miss out! Mick even went out of his way to make sure we had parking. The communication was fantastic and loved the heated floors. Plan to stay here again when we come back to Denver. "
7071425,76484061,2016-05-27,16969346,Sage,"McKenzie was very accommodating and welcoming.  The apartment was so great, and we loved coming back in the middle of a day of exploring Denver to relax for a bit.  The decor and design was beautiful, and we loved sitting on the deck while drinking our coffee in the morning.  Great stay!"
24161341,498446481,2019-07-29,12113087,Claire,Perfect place to stay in Denver! Kerry was a great host— the space was amazing— super clean and thoughtful touches.

26862329,445121941,2019-04-28,245531433,Kate,"I really enjoyed my stay here! My favorite part was the location - I enjoy walking and I was able to walk to RiNo, Molly Brown House, all around Capitol Hill, and to the Botanic Gardens. Tons of restaurants and coffee shops nearby and the residential neighborhood is pretty and quiet. If you're a light sleeper, note that I could hear the upstairs tenants' foot steps pretty clearly. That didn't bother me and I slept fine. It was also a little chilly, as Kristin notes, but the space warmer worked wonders to warm up the whole space. For the area and niceness and privacy of the apartment, this was a great deal."
13845981,408496039,2019-02-04,173667147,Kadee,Great place to stay! Can’t complain at all. Would definitely consider again if we’re back in Colorado.
915016,165610339,2017-07-01,54740900,Elise,"Great location in Capitol Hill neighborhood! Tim and Cindy were excellent communicators and let me know ahead of time that there may be some construction noise during my stay as they complete their other unit. I didn't experience any inconveniences from construction noise or traffic. The unit was clean and had many amenities available for use. The location is within walking distance of many bars and restaurants, and Tim and Cindy left a list of wonderful recommendations. I will definitely return if I am ever back in Denver."
14058998,490435360,2019-07-18,75038251,Mark,"Nice easy helpfull , nice neighbourhood , quiet, Some nice places to eat ."
6333040,225214709,2018-01-05,77368417,Rebekah,Mick and Patrick's carriage house is nothing short of a dream! The house was as pictured and expected with great location to food and shopping. We felt welcome and right at home. We would recommend their place to anyone and cannot wait to come back ourselves!
24302966,428295905,2019-03-24,24588271,Bradley,Not the best location or neighborhood. Quick walk to RiNo but would not walk it at night. Served its purpose as we used it to sleep only.
15817834,405843658,2019-01-27,132852649,Amy,"Clean, beautiful, and spacious. Close to downtown. Very cozy! Would definitely stay again!"
14962333,197191155,2017-09-24,49101606,Elizabeth,Staying at Sarsha's place was perfect.  We were so close to everything yet far enough away that it was quiet and not super busy.  Easy walking distance to many fun restaurants and shops. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed and was advertised.
26201544,526306409,2019-09-08,271812293,Cassie,"Thank you for being so close to the airport! Our flight got in late and it was nice to not drive far. Also, thank you for having the air mattress already filled and made up! We all had our own beds and literally fell into them!"
28057388,367378761,2019-01-04,223873445,Eric,"I am having a hard time figuring out what is best a bout this place.  The great, clean, well taken care of place.  Or is it the great location with close proximity to anything for an entire family to enjoy?  Or is it the amazing host that went above and beyond meeting and exceeding our needs our needs.  We stayed here for about 3 weeks while my son was at the St Lukes Hospital.  We had everything we needed at this place for comfortable stay for our self and our kids.  It is a clean and well maintained location, convenient to things needed for daily life.  With the park and school close by, our kids stayed active and had fun playing and meeting new friends.  Brian is an amazing host and did a great job.  He even asked and did, come in and cleaned the place on our schedule.  It was my first and not my last AirB&B experience.  If everyone hosts as well as Brian, I will be a lifetime user."

The communication was also very fast and able to answer any questions and concerns. Would suggest to anyone looking for a place to stay in Denver.
22506969,248552615,2018-03-31,176584590,Karoline,"Shanna and Chris have the cutest house ever. Looks just like the photos and descriptions and it’s very cosy, well decorated and well equipped. They answered all our questions in few minutes and let us do a late check in so we wouldn’t carry our bags around the city. The house was very clean and all amenities available. Street parking is easy to find and the neighborhood is quiet and safe.

I would recommend this house for everyone and hopefully, I can come back (:"
14627385,101450085,2016-09-13,91320578,Jeff,"It was a good location for us and felt safe. Sean answered very fast if we had any questions. If you request something he will do his best to provide it. For me the shower was a bit short being taller than 5' 5"" but for my wife it was fine. Sean is a very friendly person and will give you suggestion on where to eat or places to go and how to get there. Overall a good experience and a good host."
3425074,436658962,2019-04-13,148419463,Andrew,"Kimberly’s place was excellent. She is an excellent host, who really takes time to ensure you are taking care of."

22067634,243942336,2018-03-17,27258935,Tyler,"Stephanie's place is very clean and comfortable, a very good value. Parking is a hassle, but you are provided a parking pass that allows you to park overnight curbside. I suggest finding a parking spot and not moving your car if possible. I only have one minor complaint and that is the water pressure is a bit low, and it took a while for the shower to warm up. Other than that it's a great stay."
12288253,128548394,2017-01-25,47472093,Jake,"Great place surrounded by great food. Lauren was absent, but her friend was house sitting and made us feel right at home. "

The bed  was comfy as well. Only note that because it's an old house the apartment was chilly but with blankets we were all good. "
29905999,451401913,2019-05-11,25427534,Kyle,"The place was clean and quiet.  An excellent location central to the arts district in Denver, and an easy bike ride to the CBD."

1594161,480433363,2019-07-02,33767454,Janelle,"We loved our stay! Brian and Tarryn were both amazingly friendly and laid back. It's true you walk through the kitchen upstairs to get to the basement apartment, but it didn't feel awkward at all, given how welcoming they are. Tarryn gave us a great dinner recommendation within walking distance. The beds were very comfortable, everything sparkling clean. The kitchen was even stocked with some breakfast items and snacks. It was like we were staying with friends! Thank you!"
26082896,325062522,2018-09-18,932656,Tyler,"Wow, my family stayed here and we really loved this home! Huge backyard was perfect for the kiddos and relaxing outside for dinner. The place had really cool decor everywhere you turned. And best of all, we slept amazingly - the kids even slept through the night.  There is a great coffee shop just a block away.

He's close to the airport and I was so surprised he answered my 11pm request! This was an extremely clean and comfortable bed, bedroom, bath etc.  Brian was great in helping me find his new home which is also in a very new development.  Loved being so close to the airport. I will definitely look for this Airbnb again if I need something close to DIA. :-)"
24906976,563027632,2019-11-11,113462005,Kassidy,"This place is perfect for someone traveling for work and even comfortably fit two people. Caren is a lovely host and has so many welcoming touches that make it feel like the perfect mix of home and hotel. She truly has thought of everything you could need in this little place and it's at a great price as well. There are kiddos upstairs that you can hear sometimes, but we did not mind especially with fast wifi and access to a great TV setup!"

It was very clean and it’s convenient to great restaurants nearby. 

We only had one request of our host and he was prompt to respond. We will try to stay here again when we travel to Denver again."
1959918,245308914,2018-03-21,116269436,Chet,Mike's place is really good. That Nintendo was amazing. True throw back and nice touch. Checkin and checkout was amazingly simple. The place overall was really clean . Mike was very responsive to all my questions so that was appreciated. The location is ok. You do have a shared wall with neighbors so you can hear them if they are speaking loudly and vice versa. The neighboorhood is ok. Perfect for business trip not sure if I would stay here with my girlfirend just because house is right on corner of the street. So I could see some people feeling weird about that. Other than that great place.

I suggest walking to downtown. Beautiful architecture and fall trees as well as an awesome pedestrian bridge over the river into a cute little park. We took advantage of the free 16th street mall shuttle. The space really feels like a little home. It has its own parking space and cute little backyard area. Also, upon Sarshas suggestion we visited Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox for dinner and a show. It was a great little place. Highly recommend it!  We also took a couple of Lyft rides at night after drinks and they were never over $7. That’s how close this space is to downtown."

I appreciated the text I received a few days before the trip explaining the combo lock on the door & telling us the items that were there for us to enjoy. The extra essentials left in the bathroom for anyone that forgot anything was a great touch!

Erik was quick to respond to our texts at a late hour. Our only complaints are that we were short a towel (Thankfully,  our guest had brought his own towel), and was only left 1 extra roll of toilet paper for 4 guests, & there was no hand soap left in the bathroom."

The apartment was exactly what was described, Kimberly turned on a few lights and the ceiling fan which made us feel like we were coming home.  Everything was clean and tidy, the bed was extremely comfortable, the kitchen was full of natural light and stocked with coffee.  As Kimberly mentioned, there was no television however, with good tunes one is not necessary.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  We thoroughly agree with Kimberly that it is the best in Denver, and we explored everywhere.  We really had the feeling of living and being a part of the neighborhood.  We will definitely request to stay here again on our next trip to Denver."

Kelsey even baked us pumpkin bread one morning! Their home is beautiful. You have your own room (super comfy bed!) and bathroom, and access to the common areas as well. Their place is very centrally located and the free street parking was great. And, of course, then there is Gryphon, their friendly, fluffy, francophone dog, who we adored!!!

I don't think it's a spot to spend time in but if you're in Denver for outdoorsy stuff and will be gone the whole day then this is a great spot! The bathroom is more spacious than the photos show, I was worried about the shower stall being small but it was perfectly good. No TV so bring your ipad!"

The patio even had a lovely little swing to relax on. The whole place was immaculately clean. The shared kitchen had everything you could need and it was fun to talk to other travelers there. Bathrooms had shampoo, conditioner, clean towels, hairdryer if needed. Rooms were secure and private with locks and keys provided for safety and privacy. My boyfriend and I really liked how each level of the home had a separate (from the room) but private bathroom. This location is minutes from 16th Street Mall, Larimer Square and Union Station. 

Overall: great location, safe neighborhood, super new, clean modern place with everything you could need! We made ourselves at home and felt very welcome here."

29622401,526228856,2019-09-08,54249220,Tifyane,Cheresa’s place was a great stay for a vacation with 3 dudes and a lady! The porch is just right and perfect for waking up to a morning cup for tea (tea bags kindly provided). The kitchen is a great size if cooking at home is your thing. The guide book of suggestions was great and we went about 5 places in there. Quick host response and everything accurately described.

One thing I prefer about an Airbnb is that there is just enough stuff to accommodate...not too much.  Matt's place was just like this.  Not cluttered.  Thoughtfully furnished.  Plenty of hooks for toiletry bags☺️. We noted that the kitchenette doesn't have a sink and planned our breakfast accordingly.  Regarding the layout, note that a guest must travel through both bedrooms to get to the bathroom.  Light sleepers may be bothered by this in the middle of the night.  We made it work, but I wanted to mention it for others to consider.  Everyone wants a good Airbnb experience and this was a great find for us!"

13901522,94440205,2016-08-15,85684151,Murphey,Great location and setup.  Very good value for the amenities. The central AC was a little weak but there are window units in every room.  
22056178,364957530,2018-12-31,24407949,Kt,"Lisa's place is super convenient to some lovely Colfax bars and restaurants, we even took a brisk 25 minute walk to the zoo one of the afternoons we stayed. It was the perfect jumping off point for our Denver adventure."

13494022,331823017,2018-10-03,68006834,David,Great place to stay if you were going to a concert at the Fillmore or Ogden Theater. Not too far away from downtown.
25182421,411177945,2019-02-11,238517786,Nick,Great place to stay.
13204273,471498355,2019-06-17,54132454,Lauramay,This is an amazing home away from home. We love staying here when we visit Denver. It’s very relaxing

12948807,192664350,2017-09-10,119940766,Shinaide,Our stay was perfect for our friends wedding . Perfect location to many restaurants and shops just a block away. Parking was a plus to know we could leave our rental car and it was safe since we walked to a lot of  places . The house is cozy and beautifully decorated
10237203,412489612,2019-02-15,27131285,Rachel,"I had a great stay at Jess’s place! It was the perfect space for me as a solo traveler, & I appreciated having a separate entrance. The touches like plastic ware & plates were helpful since I was ordering food in, & the space was extremely clean. Jess was also super responsive to my messages. Thank you!"
21994210,295937150,2018-07-24,96812541,Tianna,This place is absolutely amazing. It had everything we needed to be comfortable. The location is close to all necessities. I highly recommend this home. 
29212648,408572679,2019-02-04,31299130,Ryan,This was an amazing Airbnb. Great location. Great value. Tons of space. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Denver. Just a short walk or scooter ride to anywhere downtown.
20902989,496573886,2019-07-27,68627697,Justin,Great accommodation but a fair bit away from downtown Denver.
10248217,124774489,2017-01-02,48108267,Eduardo,Enjoyed our stay very much. Listing was exactly as advertised. Nice neighborhood--short walks to coffee shop/restaurant/grocery store and short ride to Downtown Denver and surrounding areas. 
17341684,418224725,2019-03-01,65062454,Calli,"Clean, nice place in a great neighborhood. Close to everything with plenty of street parking. Love love love Mason and will definitely stay here should we visit again."
19435120,228652721,2018-01-20,119244365,Kim,"We can’t say enough positive things about David and Cathy’s place! From the thoughtful notes and treats left for us, to the quick responses to any questions, everything was top notch! The space was quaint and clean. It was within walking distance to many area attractions and a cheap, quick Uber or Lyft if we didn’t feel like walking. It was a lovely stay and we would definitely stay here again!"
23669031,340093677,2018-10-22,209359523,Gulden,"My research group stayed at this house to work for 3 nights. It was a perfect house for us to get some work done. There were many great restaurants, grocery and a park walking distance and it was very close to the airport. We had 5 guests flying from different locations and met at this house to get some great work done. Since the restaurants and grocery were at a walking distance, we did not waste any time for food. The living room spaces provided us great places to get in small and big groups to have our discussions done. The neighborhood was very quiet as well. The house was very clean and had all our needed items (kitchen for basic cooking, tv for projecting work for group discussions, spacious bedrooms, etc.). The internet connection was spotty time to time but we think it was due to having several computers and phones trying to connect. Jordan was great to provide answers quickly. Recommend this house highly!"
4344095,75427151,2016-05-21,45481538,William,"It was a beautiful home with everything we needed. The location has easy access to downtown and up and coming businesses. It had a great urban atmosphere. We had a great stay, cheers "
25540293,531087411,2019-09-16,173728317,Kristen,"Really cute space! Sydney let us check in several hours early since our flight got in really early that morning- that was great! We really appreciated her being so accommodating! 

The location is great. We walked almost every place we wanted to go or took a short uber ride- even to Red Rocks with traffic the uber ride wasn’t bad at all! All of the servers and wait staff at all of the places around us were great! All super nice and super helpful for suggesting fun places to go or sights to see. 

The only thing we weren’t expecting was the layout of the apartment. It may be my fault for not reading the listing thoroughly or asking more questions but we didn’t realize the hosts home was directly above us and the walls are so thin, it felt like we were all in the same apartment a lot of the time! We were whispering a lot when we were there because we could hear their conversations and just felt kind of weird talking at a normal level. We didn’t spend a ton of time in the apartment so it wasn’t a deal breaker. 

I would still recommend staying here!"
21782254,553607659,2019-10-24,69001792,Ashley,This is THE place to stay if you want to see all of downtown Denver! The stay is within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The space is very cute and clean and the host is great and very responsive!
13117272,318413695,2018-09-03,125024496,Lindsey,"We were in town for a long weekend and this place was the best! Lots of room, GREAT kitchen, cozy beds, super cute backyard, and a great host. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat."
1733052,129572034,2017-01-31,1644179,Raj,"Absolutely comfortable place to stay, it was a plush man-cave: clean, hygienic and well equipped. The pictures don't show it well, it's actually much better. 
We checked in late so did not have a chance to meet Jason and his wife but everything was set in place for us to check in and check out. Definitely recommend and will come back again. "
14962389,507661769,2019-08-11,96893169,Jordan,Great spot!
14043521,221484044,2017-12-26,87072275,Amy,"Brett was the perfect host; communication was excellent and he was extremely flexible with special requests for check-in and check-out.
The house is immaculate, well equipped, and centrally located for everything Denver has to offer.
Outstanding in every category....we would definitely stay there again!!"
6954236,64642992,2016-03-06,57554621,Brandon,I enjoyed my stay in Jared's space. He called the first night to ensure we had everything we needed and to assist us in anyway possible. The space is exactly as nice as the pictures. The location is great for those who dont like to travel far in a new city. Everything you will need is less then 10mins away. I will be staying here the next time i visit Denver.
25195731,345715198,2018-11-05,1789660,Billy,Grandpa’s Place is great— you will definitely enjoy staying here! Convenient location and SO close to amazing restaurants!

3992779,116032118,2016-11-27,21286617,Wynne,"Listing was accurate, it is a small space. It was chilly when we were there (there's a space heater provided thought). We spent two nights here. Cute, residential neighborhood very close to a Whole Foods and 7/11. We found it an easy walk to everything we wanted to see. Elizabeth was out of town, but her roommate Kyle was great."
7603546,258211877,2018-04-28,63376279,Gregory,Was great! Thanks Dennis!
21377389,208284301,2017-10-31,143400584,Jennifer,Conveniently located and loved the bunk beds.
37707661,540055714,2019-10-02,127575784,Nick,"Kate’s place was a beautiful, comfortable place for our two week stay. The location was fantastic!  The hosts were available for anything we needed, but also respectful of our privacy. I highly recommend this place!"
25229354,414035060,2019-02-18,23695570,Robert Lee,"Chris+Allison's place is really cool. You have a separate entrance and the check-in is really easy. The place is very centric, there's coffee shops and restaurants a block away, and a Trader Joe's a few blocks away. We visited in winter and there were plenty of blankets available. Truly a 5-star stay."
22123062,420738132,2019-03-07,174805365,Rick,"I don't ordinarily offer mediocre reviews, but in the interest of helping out others, I have to disclose that we were pretty disappointed with our experience here, for a couple of reasons.  

First, the hosts were very into nickle-and-diming us.  We stayed nearly a full three weeks but they wouldn't spring to have someone come clean the place/launder the linens and towels even once - notwithstanding that surely we were paying more than they would have received had we left and the place had sat un-rented.  This one instance of unwillingness to accommodate may have been ok.  But at the end of our time we asked if we might stay four extra hours.  They replied that we could stay only two hours and then ONLY if we paid $20!  This was pretty nervy, because at the beginning of our stay the place was not ready on time (we were scheduled for a 3:00 p.m. check-in but the place wasn't ready until 4:30).  It didn't bother us at the time - we weren't ready by 3:00 anyway - but to expect us to pay to stay longer is pretty annoying when the hosts did not offer us any commensurate discount when the place wasn't ready at the beginning. 

Second, the place is a bit more threadbare than the photos suggest.  The sink in the kitchen is coming up out of the counter, there is literally a hole at the bottom of the wall in the back room leading to the utility room, the drapes have tears and patches, the sofa is stained and torn.  It's liveable and clean, but the pictures make it seem much more pristine than it actually is.  There isn't even a dresser for your clothes.  Also, this isn't really the host's fault, but heating in this bungalow is pretty inefficient - it's either way too hot or way too cold all the time. 

We actually had to stay in the Denver area longer and we would have extended our stay but for the nickle-and-diming mentioned above.  We found a much better place (with dishwasher and laundry room and much more space) for $100 less a night near Lakewood."
17154609,192958169,2017-09-11,121535052,Liam David,Ahmed was awesome. The apartment is incredible.
852934,22366147,2014-11-04,21951162,Kieran,"Our trip was made so much easier/less stressful with Tom's support. Could not imagine a better accommodation for a weekend getaway. Tom was there when we needed and gave us our privacy otherwise. Location was great and convenient for our purposes (biking, running, taking the rail into the city). Highly recommended!"
13656664,128584816,2017-01-25,22762139,Katherine,The host canceled this reservation 219 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7912052,231746589,2018-02-02,120287633,Adrian,My third stay with Aki and Haroko was just as nice as my previous two.  They realy go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.
19309366,194886336,2017-09-17,8143687,Susan,"Julie provided clear, detailed instructions and was very responsive to queries. Her place is cozy and well maintained and was a pleasure to stay in."
6913874,327944344,2018-09-24,3350953,Rebecca,"Great spot with just the right stuff. Bonus: nice, simple check out process. Perfect home base for 1-2 people to explore Denver. Plus quick and friendly communications!"
11377981,203251319,2017-10-14,31318738,Geoff,"During my stay, I had a phenomenal time with the roommates and was the perfect location for my 8 week internship. Overall company with the Shelley and the roommates helped with fun suggestions around Denver and Boulder since I'm not from around there. Shelley was quick with responses, however a few things that were to be looked at weren't addressed immediately. The door lock and water filter on the fridge was my biggest concern and was brought up  to her during my first week, which was not addressed. I'd advise to take a look at the place prior before making the stay, she's nice and the roommates are also great! Cheers!"
38153312,538285367,2019-09-29,40167807,Nancy,"Such a Great space! They were attentive and easy to work with!
Loved this space & hosts!!!"
852934,24794870,2015-01-02,25279905,Zachary,Tom was very generous and warming. Everything was exactly as described and more. He had the fridge stocked with goods and other foods we may need while we were there. He parked in the street so my gf and I could park in the driveway due to the snowy roads and cold weather. I would recommend this location to anyone! 
2908978,78896991,2016-06-10,42137861,Tamara,I had a lovely time.  My room and the house was just as  it was described in the pics. The home was very clean and well appointed. Rita made it easy to come and go. The house is in beautiful Congress Park. Great host and great experience. I would recommend Rita's home to anyone who is visiting Denver.
23123917,357146072,2018-12-09,57392611,Elizabeth,My friends and I agreed that this was one of the best Airbnb homes that we’ve stayed in. Soraya was very communicative along the way and the place had everything that we needed. We’ll definitely book again the next time we want to stay in downtown Denver!
14369542,298810478,2018-07-29,45039740,Taylor,"If you are going to Denver you have to stay here! Jenn and Jay were so thoughtful and amazing hosts! Amazing upstairs space, very clean, coffee bar, fridge, Brita, and even a cute WiFi board with my name on it. These two are the best!!!"
12890649,512918604,2019-08-18,193748886,Jack,"Cecilia is a great host and very responsive to any needs. The house is spacious for big groups and everyone was comfortable. Great basic stock in the kitchen and the outdoor patio is a great bonus. Location could not be better, the areas within walking distance have everything and it’s a short ride to almost anywhere in Denver. Highly recommend for any large group looking to keep everyone together in a prime location."
31567020,405179854,2019-01-26,46400666,Nicola,The condo was adorable and comfortable. Everything was neat and new. Excellent communication and hospitality. Would absolutely stay again.

Our private bedroom, bathroom and tv room were clean and beautifully decorated. The whole apartment was wonderful!! She helped us set up the air mattress and even put the bedding on while we were out! We had to leave early the next morning otherwise we would have spent more time in the apartment and on the gorgeous deck. It was close to everything we were visiting and we would love to stay here again! Thank you Maura!"

Room was cozy and perfect for a short term stay. Would recommend!"

22379059,426602896,2019-03-21,246193417,Zaarah,"Great place to stay in Denver! The space is clean and stocked with almost anything you’d need: good coffee, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, plenty of dinnerware, snacks, and many other thoughtful touches. The walls are a little thin so you might hear some noises and you have to remember to park on the street (it was not hard to find parking). Overall it’s better than I expected and I would stay here again."

10343072,494690526,2019-07-24,266912129,Saeed,Had a great stay at Allison’s place. Felt very comfortable in her beautiful house and its quiet neighbourhood. The house is well equipped with all one might need and matches its given descriptions. Allison was very quick in her responses whenever we had a question and showed genuine concern for our comfort. Would definitely go again!

6410804,328637409,2018-09-26,65004687,Lindsey,"I definitely recommend staying at Jerry's place. He is a extremely hospitable and very flexible with arrangements. His dog, Birdie, is adorable and very friendly. Check-in was super simple with the lockbox. Though there was no door upstairs, the loft still felt like my own private space. The location was fantastic for me since I work in Downtown. 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop and 25 min ride to Civic Center. Walking distance to King Soopers and the keys he provided had a shopper's card attached. I would definitely stay again."
12711498,544685777,2019-10-10,81925182,Barbara,"Beautiful house in style, sparkling clean. Convenient location between downtown and Cherry Creek in a very nice residential area - minutes away by car from good restaurants and places to see. Kitchen is fully equipped, sofa big and comfy, and the patio with a dining table and lounge furniture in a peaceful green oasis. 
Access to the creek with bicycle and jogging trail right in front of the house is very cool. 
Marcia is an excellent host, always responded to my messages promptly ready to help. 
If we ever come to Denver again, we’d definitely ask Marcia to stay at her place again."

9523086,97487414,2016-08-27,6756692,Linda,"We had a great time staying at Eric's place in Denver. It's a very quiet place, not far from a lot of great eateries and bars. The private bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well maintained. Eric was a great host, checking in with us to make sure everything was okay, but otherwise leaving us to our own devices. He was always very quick to respond if we needed anything. The location was excellent for us to explore the Highlands and LoDo. We would definitely consider staying here again if we visit Denver in the future."
26131284,460222094,2019-05-28,11709159,Jo Ann,"With an Airbnb We are always a bit anxious about whether the pictures and descriptions are accurate. The Curtis Park Club location, room, and amenities was all that they claimed it would be and it surpassed my expectations.  I was also really surprised (and grateful ) for how quiet it was given the number of rooms and our room location next to the large common area.  And for any questions or problems we encountered, the service was efficient and excellent. We would definitely try to stay again on our next trip to Denver."
17044680,228039820,2018-01-17,27808955,Lexy,Annabelle + Christian’s place is the perfect place to stay for either solo travelers or couples. The bed is wonderful and they have an amazing shower with jacuzzi tub. The stars at night are beautiful which can be seen from their awesome balcony. It was a safe neighborhood and I would definitely stay here again in my future visits to Denver.
11722154,211828481,2017-11-14,53218144,Lindsay,"A nice cozy basement apartment in a great location! The hosts and the dogs were awesome. AJ was easy to communicate with, and very helpful."
34185431,467665889,2019-06-10,184845324,William,"Good value place to stay for the night. It's a little out in the ghetto, so don't expect too much -but will do the trick. The (large) shower was especially nice! Be aware that there are two friendly dogs who live there, and they will certainly greet you with energy and enthusiasm. Had a nice time talking with Chris as well, who was around off and on for most of our stay."
26281796,456490065,2019-05-21,46657049,Lenka,Everything was as great as during our last stay.

Arrival was arranged via messages and couldn't have been easier. We enjoyed the porch and parking spot, both were nice perks to an already lovely experience at Hannah's. "
24043228,312067822,2018-08-22,74394509,John,"Thank you Seth and Jennifer,  I had a great time at the carriage house. Great location to Tennyson. About 15 min from downtown/colfax. Quite neighborhood, very safe. Love that the carriage is fenced in, in the backyard. Driveway was great for parking. The shower was a nice touch. AC unit in bedroom. There was a little hair and animal hair in the sheets and comforter, but besides that very clean. Dishwasher and washing machine. No dryer. A bunch of coffee shops, Restaurants and bars within walking distance. Overall I would recommend the carriage house to potential visitors. "

I booked a room in his home last minute after leaving a terrible AirBnB and he saved my trip. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful! Thanks for a great stay!
861993,178509815,2017-08-05,15095179,David,The place was so comfortable. The hot tub is really big and situated in a really lush garden. This is a Denver paradise. The neighborhood was really lovely as well. We enjoyed walking around the lake and visiting some very nice bars and an art gallery nearby.

30462500,533503254,2019-09-21,189425553,Kayla,"The location is awesome and the house is super cute. The hosts are super responsive. Be aware that there is no A/C. Only fans and a swamp cooler in the bedroom. I'm sure that for most months A/C isn't needed in Denver, but during our stay, it was in the 80s."
769437,8044525,2013-10-14,8401569,Ellen,"Simone and Joel's home was warm and welcoming, as was their friendly cat Lola.  The downstairs bedroom and bathroom were beautifully decorated, very cozy.  We enjoyed walking through the historic neighborhood to the convention center (about 30 minutes away).  Many of the older homes en route had been beautifully renovated, like Simone and Joel's.  Thanks again!  Hope to see you next year!  "

Annabelle + Christian we're amazing hosts that went above and far beyond what I expected from my first AirBnB experience.

I would definitely stay here again given the chance!!"

9169634,106598162,2016-10-07,92709762,Brieanna,The place was decked out in witty decor and stocked with smoking supplies! Located near some great dispensaries and the area was very safe! We walked at night and felt no fear! Definitely a good place to stay to see Denver if you're able to Uber or drive around to other places of the city. 
787456,21665446,2014-10-21,21342160,Helen,"Pam and Brad are excellent hosts. They made me feel most welcome and were very helpful in me finding my way around Denver and surrounds. It was home away from home. Very relaxed. Just what I was looking for. A few days back to Australia, and I am missing Pamela's home-made bread. Perfect position opposite the lovely Denver Botanical Gardens, and close to buses if you aren't up to walking into the city which is very doable.  If I ever find myself in a lucky position to visit Denver again, I will definitely return to this Airbnb. "
6187302,99678160,2016-09-05,26112707,Eleanor,"We had a great stay at Joshua's house while we were in Denver! We were 6 childhood friends getting together for a long weekend. Comfy beds, clean, all the basics you could possibly need. We had coffee on the cute outdoor patio in the morning and definitely made good use of the garage. "

Seriously, one of the best showers. They are the sweetest hosts and checked in with us regularly to see if we needed anything. They had great recommendations for places to go. The back patio was perfect, a quiet oasis to hang out in, and they even joined us for conversation. We will definitely stay with them on our next trip to Denver! "

The place was impeccable with a kitchen area and with the best water pressure and shower I've ever had (with a rain shower head too).  It was in a quite neighborhood with a private entrance, internet, tv, and chromecast capabilities.  Amberly was really accommodating and helpful.  She provided tips and suggestions for places to visit and things to do.  I would definitely stay with her again!"
38049943,535117713,2019-09-23,84784966,Sarah,"This house is in a great/convenient location, adorable neighborhood and is way cuter than the pictures even show. 

The neighborhood was quiet and we really enjoyed being able to sit on the enclosed porch when we had our morning coffee. 

Erin was a great host and we are so glad we picked her house for our stay. It made our trip more cozy."

4545539,69225701,2016-04-10,663381,Lynn,"Just spent two nights at Tyler's place, and it was wonderful!!! Tyler communicated with me right after I booked and the day before getting in to Denver -- all instructions were clear and check in was a breeze. Tyler was also very gracious in allowing us flexible check in and check out since our arrival/departure were late. The apartment itself is fantastic -- much more spacious than it seems in the pictures and super clean. We especially loved the bathroom, which is HUGE, with an amazing shower and tons of storage space (there's a big area in the back where you can hang clothing). Although we didn't really use the kitchen, it is fully equipped to make meals. The neighborhood is also great (and quiet), with tons of restaurants just a block away. We ate at the Hornet, Sputnik and Piehole -- all very good and reasonably priced. Coffee at the Metropolis is excellent. We would love to stay here again when we're in Denver next. Thank you so much, Tyler!"
31209470,452171556,2019-05-12,16790688,Ailsa,Would definitely stay again! Great spot.

14932614,299342799,2018-07-30,201577388,Satarra,"By far my favorite host. Just outside of the city with amazing views and adorable patio area. Joseph provided fresh fruit, coffee and breakfast options which was very thoughtful. Overall wonderful stay! "

36807205,507611359,2019-08-11,9631496,Calisce,This is a spacious renovated suite with a friendly host and cute dogs! It's walking distance from a few nice restaurants but suburban enough to be peaceful at night. I only regret not claiming the upstairs bedroom when we arrived with our friends - it's twice as big and closer to the luxurious bathroom!
9108143,216782927,2017-12-05,346579,Peter,Great location and home. Highly recommend and would stay here again if I ever come back to Denver.
3479122,344441711,2018-11-03,773482,Aj,"We really enjoyed our stay in Sam’s place.  The unique design takes advantage of the height of the location.  The area was quite, surprisingly so at night, and the courtyard was a great place to hangout.  Everyone was very friendly and Sam and Jessica were very responsive. (Thanks for the great Thai suggestion!)

The layout is such that you need to be comfortable with stairs.  There are three flights of stairs to get to the apartment and then the three (technically four) levels of the space. You walk in to the kitchen and there are a couple of steps up to the living/dining room.  The bedroom area is up and the tv room/office is down.  Everything was functional and made our stay like being at home.

One note about the bathroom - there is only one, and it is upstairs in the bedroom space (loft), which may be an issue if you have visitors.  Also, the shower and toilet are separated from the sleeping area by a door, the sink is just outside that door, in the sleeping area. The shower was fine but the commode space was just a bit tight.

If our travels took us back to this part of Denver, we’d stay in this area, and in this space, again."
14087278,293587909,2018-07-20,31748638,Hilary,I can’t stress enough how perfect Jackie’s place is for a stay in Denver. Her home is beautiful and so centrally located you can walk anywhere. The surrounding neighborhood is peaceful but also includes some great restaurants and views of the city as well. Jackie was incredibly communicative. Her instructions are straightforward and she checked in throughout the stay to make sure we were comfortable and didn’t have any issues. I’d highly recommend a stay at Jackie’s for anyone visiting the Denver area!
24344869,484379161,2019-07-08,27238888,Paul,Straight forward place if you need a place to crash. Runs the house like a hotel with locks on the rooms but a communist bathroom.
13548312,225809548,2018-01-07,39973105,Frank,Great host easy checkin and out . Great stay
3412478,42192763,2015-08-11,18059519,Kaitlynn,"Brandy's home proved to be the perfect accommodations for a solo trip to explore Denver. Brandy was extremely accessible at all times and incredibly communicative. The location was perfect for me -- halfway between the airport and Red Rocks -- which allowed me to explore the natural and urban beauty of Denver alike.  LoHi is an adorable neighborhood just a few blocks southwest with independently owned boutiques and cafes.  The bed was SO comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the house was fully prepared for guests (down to labeling the trash & recycle cans, a reminder to refill the Brita pitcher, etc.) I thoroughly enjoyed my time -- thanks for opening up your home, Brandy! "
21028558,357553858,2018-12-10,97675343,Krystal,"The home has plenty of space with 2 separate family areas, a beautiful kitchen in case you need to cook while you are there, and close to lots of restaurants, Starbucks, and King Soopers grocery store.

The house was charming and every detail was met. I am such a sucker for location and I fell in love! The streets were lined with beautiful green trees! I am from LA, so I’m such a sucker for anything green. The room was big and towels were provided for me! Would definitely recommend and stay if I’m ever in the area :) "
1959836,11285508,2014-03-28,1477300,Lydelle,"My friends and I fell in love with Denver immediately, in no small part because of Anne's hospitality. Cozy beds, in the home of a talented artist. What more could you want? Nothing. Thank you Anne!!"

17430797,218737263,2017-12-14,7433468,Bill,"What a great place to stay! I loved your neighborhood feel, the ability to walk just a few blocks to a nice grocery store and the ease of using public transit from the airport and around the city during my weeklong stay. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook for the week, the main room had comfortable places to sit and relax and there is a nice firm bed.  Most of all, Mardy was such a nice host and I would come back with no hesitation at all and would recommend highly."

4191778,484891943,2019-07-09,156294197,Kevin,"Accepted to let us check in earlier, very reactive to mails and very nice. Isolation could be a little better as it gets a little noisy."

6730800,147063729,2017-04-24,125962308,Deborah,"Really adorable property. Terrific location with great places to eat nearby. The kitchen is not well stocked as far as utensils and dishes. (2 coffee mugs for a property that accommodates 4 people) 
Night parking is a pain. Make no mistake, even late at night you're lucky to find a spot even two blocks out. 
The photos don't really show it but the stairs are treacherous!!!
Great shower/small bathroom. 
Not good for elderly guests. 
Couldn't get wifi. "

26261457,336031481,2018-10-13,188503296,Maria,"Gina was an amazing host and her place was great!! She was super helpful and accommodating. Our flight didn’t leave until 7pm but we had a bunch of bags from our camping trip with us. We didn’t necessarily want to haul those around all day, so Gina extended our check out time and made arrangements between us and the next guest so we could leave our bags there and just come back to grab them before heading to the airport. It was super helpful and we loved our stay there!"
17251698,426321591,2019-03-20,248231495,Brian,"An incredible value and pleasant stay!  The hosts were very friendly, personable and accommodating.

We did a lot of traveling while we were there and the house was a great place to come back to.  Plenty big for my sister and I and very clean.  Loved the roomy closets and the kitchen is awesome (even though we didn’t really use it!).  This was my first trip to Denver, and I don’t think it will be my last.  I would definitely stay here again!"

The neighbourhood is superb, safe and just a short walk to downtown. Restaurants and grocery store around the corner.
Jim made us feel at home and he gave us great suggestions of things to do in Denver. His whole family is really warm and considerate. We're so glad we got to meet these amazing people and that we stayed in this amazing house!"
12991472,552517480,2019-10-21,60065071,Adam,Great place very close to a lot of action. Not so close that it's too noisy to get rest. Highly recommended.
31117836,512857826,2019-08-18,214754010,Sarah,"The townhouse is within walking distance from the train making it extra easy to get to and from the airport. The RiNo district has amazing food and bar options, a little something for everyone. My friends and I walked a lot, but there are ubers and lyfts abound if the good ol' heel toe express isn't for you. The townhouse itself was very clean, easy to check in and out of, and the beds were very comfortable. We couldn't have had a better stay. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to my friends and family. Enjoy!"
7070662,58765324,2016-01-05,34817520,Michael,McKenzie was a great host who was just a call or text away. The house was beautifully furnished and very warm and inviting. Our group had a phenomenal time being so close to so many different spots around Denver. 
20829286,240895685,2018-03-06,39246344,Tabitha,"Steph's place is wonderful. The space is in the back of the house in the basement. There  is a private entrance and once you get in there are a set of stairs to get to downstairs. The house is cozy and welcoming. The bed with desk has the most wonderful sheets - one of the best parts of the place!! I travel alot, typically at hotels - Steph's place felt like we were staying at a friends house. Coffee maker, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste - a nice surprise. We also got to meet Steph and her adorable puppy - Izzie. I would recommend Steph's place. Its quiet and centrally located to everything!"
11080835,120476055,2016-12-10,4251401,Jonathan,"One of the best AirBnb's I have ever stayed in.   Rebecca is a great host, and the bed/room was incredibly comfortable!"

We went to a baseball game, which was only a mile or so away. We also really enjoyed the neighborhood, I think we hopped around the highlands more then downtown Denver! Totally would stay again!"

26661010,307154942,2018-08-13,5826858,Michelle,"This space is perfect for a younger couple who want to experience downtown Denver. The LoDo area is quiet during the day but the listing is not joking when it reminds you that it's a city, and with that comes city noise: the windows in this place face a rooftop bar, which we could hear from happy hour through to about 2am. I don't rent AirBnBs in cities to go to bed at a reasonable hour, so it wasn't ever an issue for me, but it easily could be for someone hoping for a good nights right beginning at 10 or 11pm. 

Aside from that, the space is really charming, full of personal knick knacks and charm. If there was a TV or wifi I'm not aware of it. The location was unbelievably perfect, never more than a 12 minute Uber to any of what I wanted to do, although we were able to walk and take advantage of the 16th street bus (free) for a lot of getting around. 

All in all I recommend this as a budget friendly, cozy alternative to a hotel room. Cassandra was absolutely lovely to work with and accommodated my schedule (early check in and late check out) without hesitation. I would definitely rent again. "
21380975,536922355,2019-09-27,135081746,Issa,Great place in good neighborhood! Would definitely recommend this place if your in Denver.

I found Alex to be pleasant and responsive to our needs which added to the overall comfort of our time there...We would certainly choose to stay at her if passing this way again....

Thanks for everything buddy, and Merry Christmas,

17498473,164273360,2017-06-26,6090315,Angel,"A few days before our arrival, Rafer informed us of a plumbing issue they had that resulted in having to tear up some of the wooden floorboards in the unit. Though they weren't able to replace the flooring before our stay, everything in the unit was still fully functional and we were offered a discount for the inconvenience.  We did not experience any plumbing issues during our 6 night stay, but after being asked by our host to switch out the 2-ply toilet paper for 1-ply juuuuuust in case, we did find ourselves wondering if this could be a reoccurring issue.

We had a late arrival and a jam packed itinerary each day, so having our own private entrance with self check-in, as well as being located in a central area with public transportation only blocks away was ideal. The kitchen was fully stocked with a few basic breakfast items, dishes and cookware. The only additions I would have made would be a frying pan and some salt and pepper!

We didn't get a chance to interact much with our hosts because we had  many places to go and people to see each day, but both Channing and Rafer were very communicative before, during, and after our stay.  The unit was everything we needed it to be."
27396737,431222994,2019-03-31,1340484,Alix,"This house is sparkling clean, fully stocked, and very comfortable. It is also incredibly beautiful and eclectic in terms of decor. A real show-stopper! Cole was responsive and helpful. The binder contained lots of great suggestions for local activities, and we wished we had more time to checkthem all out.  We couldn't recommend this property more highly, and will stay here again. You have to see it for yourself!"

The townhouse was very spacious and clean, with all amenities that you could want.  And Ben is a fantastic host - extremely nice and welcoming, and very quick at responding to messages.  Only hiccup of the stay was the brief leak in one of the bathrooms when a freak hailstorm came through, but Ben was on top of it.  Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Denver!"

33614607,497676278,2019-07-28,212251058,Laura,"This house was the perfect fit for a group of four visiting Denver. The bedrooms were separated which was nice for privacy, and the common areas were able to be enjoyed by all. We had an easy time navigating the neighborhood, and loved walking around exploring the area. There was a nice selection of unique restaurants and breweries within a 15 minute walk. I would love to stay here again!"
4288813,271944995,2018-06-02,13246657,Katie,"This was the perfect place for our stay in Denver. It is immaculately clean, cute local touches in the decor, and has all the amenities you might need. Do not worry about the lack of central air - there's a standing AC unit in the bedroom. We were there for three 90+ degree days and we were more than comfortable! The location is ideal - walking distance to coffee shops, breweries, great food, Larimer, Coors Field, the downtown area, etc. Great communication from our hosts. We'd definitely stay here again!"

Thoughtful touches around the apartment, a thorough guide of local restaurants, grocery stores, and attractions, and a well prepped kitchen for cooking really made the trip less stressful. She also made herself available easily which was a plus. Highly recommend!"

26520064,355361599,2018-12-03,39658186,Travis,"Absolutely loved this space, it went above and beyond.  Others' positive reviews of Doug's bnb were accurate and I had to add mine to the list. It was roomy, incredibly clean and comfy and full of useful amentities. Doug was friendly and prvoided good suggestions for restaurants etc, and accommodated our extra guests/blow up matress. The neighborhood was beautiful yet also direct and convenient to get to downtown from. The value of this space is insane."

17175955,491725114,2019-07-20,32619068,Josh,"What can I say about this house that hasn't already been said. They are super hosts for a reason. I loved the location. We were in a cute little TV'esque neighborhood with sidewalks and tree lines streets with coffee houses, shops, and little restaurants within in walking distance; yet we were only a 10-15 minute car ride from downtown Denver. It was perfect and we loved meeting Susan. If we get the chance to go back to Denver I will plan it around staying in this place. 
Everything was clean and all the essentials were provided plus extras, like board games and condiments for anything cooking you may want to do. We loved having coffee on the back porch on the cool mornings. We had room for 6 and were never cramped because of the amazing living spaces both on the main floor and downstairs."
3961440,19969374,2014-09-21,19743993,Sean,"Erika is a wonderful host. Her room is welcoming and clean. The Sunnyside neighborhood is fantastic - it has quick access to downtown as well as a charming local restaurant scene.

Having stayed at a lot of AirBnBs, I know that ""private"" is relative when booking a private room. I can honestly say that I felt that I had a ton of privacy and quiet when staying at Erika's house, while at the same time she was an available and giving host. She has a great sense for people, she's caring, and is nice to chat with. At the same time, she's happy just to give you space.

I would definitely stay at Erika's again! This listing has great value."

It’s located super close to the airport in a very nice, new neighborhood. I enjoyed the use of the fan for some white noise. The pillows were perfect. I slept great!"
3458369,401495667,2019-01-14,234818618,Travis,Awesome location in the heart of Highlands Square! Jamie and her husband made sure we felt right at home and even spread out ice melt since we stayed during a snow storm. Great experience and would go back again.

Robin wasn't hear during our stay but checked in with us multiple times to make sure things were going well. The bathroom is a bit cramped and might be tight for someone tall, but we didn't have any issues."

very centrally located and is within a short driving distance of many other great Denver interests.  FYI, we loved everything on the menu at the Jamaican restaurant just down the street."

10828998,124335377,2017-01-01,105618292,Laura,"This was a wonderful place, Susan was so kind and easy to work with.  We had the house full and it accommodated us wonderfully.  The one draw back would be if you have a FULL house only having 2 restrooms can become a headache if trying to get around at the same time.  We enjoyed our stay and when we come back through Denver we hope this residence is open.  "
21609746,283867122,2018-06-30,132923481,Courtney,"Shelley’s place is ideal for any traveler looking to experience trendy areas in Denver.

Shelley also provides a great listing of things nearby so that her guests don’t have to do all the research themselves. 

The amenities are great as well. Shelley is very thoughtful and made sure there were beers in the fridge, snacks on the table, and any toiletries you may have left behind she’s got you covered. The space is super comfortable as well. 

Overall Shelley is a great host who I would not hesitate to book with again. "

There is absolutely everything you need in this downstairs apartment - mini fridge, kitchen, private bathroom with a spectacular shower, comfy couch, and also a comfy bed with the softest sheets. Everything was immaculately clean. And a fabulous location! Portia's place is a home-run all around. I could not have had a better experience and I doubt I will be able to top Portia's place. So very highly recommend to any planning to visit Denver. "
3541671,27202738,2015-02-28,24655690,Claire,This was our first experience with Airbnb. We could not have asked for better host! Loren and Sophia were very down to earth.

I stayed for a week, and it was a comfortable space, especially for one person. It has everything you need and the location is perfect -- great restaurants within a few steps of the apartment, and a convenience store, too. The  bathroom is as small as described in the listing, so keep that in mind. It's a small space, but if you are by yourself, it's convenient and comfortable. "

Her place is very spacious for one person and also cozy. The neighborhood is quiet, yet is only two blocks from South Broadway, which has plenty of restaurants and a fun bar scene if that peaks your interest!  I wish I could have stayed longer, highly recommended!"

8800911,151908760,2017-05-14,2222322,Josh,Danny & Christy's place was perhaps the most amazing and beautiful Airbnb we have ever stayed at. I HIGHLY recommend it to enjoy your time in Denver. Can't say enough good things. Thanks so much!  
13815789,359939578,2018-12-18,10719401,Rise,"A wonderful surprise, it was much better than expected. The location and value is great! Will stay again. The cherry on top was the host calling us immediately after we left and making sure we got our bag we left behind."
19548421,410858937,2019-02-10,51658773,Aria,Great location and it’s a sweet space for a weekend getaway!

28304475,420734889,2019-03-07,1337135,Megan,"Caitlin and Keegan were such friendly hosts! They made me feel very much at home. Everything was sparkling clean and everything was well though out-even their delicious  French press coffee! Walking distance to anything you could need- great restaurants, workout classes, and bars/breweries. I'd recommend anyone stay there."
26351023,460209234,2019-05-28,77462373,Meghmic,"Carol was very helpful in providing suggestions and answering our questions (super promptly, might I add!) We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay for our first trip to Denver. Her place is so cozy and beautifully decorated with everything you’d need to feel right at home.  Highly recommend!"
14043521,483623144,2019-07-07,261609592,Katherine,This home is newly remodeled and very clean. It is centrally located and walking distance to Washington park. I would recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Colorado.
11241369,268349558,2018-05-24,113085063,Delora,"Perfect!  The house is immaculate and right in town. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do it! We had 4 adults but could have easily had 8. This was our favorite AirBnB of all time."
21042069,283865492,2018-06-30,127263916,William,Todd’s place worked out great for my business trip to Denver. Would recommend!

14946195,107671466,2016-10-11,33729617,Jennifer,"From the moment I booked my stay, Steve was friendly and quick to answer any questions I had. Check in was smooth and convenient, the home was extremely clean and comfortable, and the location couldn't be better! Steve even gave us great recommendations for places to get breakfast. The location is just steps away from a great burger place, a cute coffee shop, and a funky bar. As well as a few blocks from some awesome parks. Highly recommend! "
5379218,144083326,2017-04-14,107460272,Aysha,"I had a great time at Dr. Faye's and I would definitely recommend her place to anybody who needs a place to stay for a few months in Denver. I stayed there for nearly three months. She had a nice beautiful home with a wonderful living room and kitchen to lounge in. The bedroom was spacious with a large walk-in closest. The only downside was having to share a bathroom/shower with two other people. However, everybody is usually busy and out of the house, so it never gets crowded. Also, they were all really friendly and welcoming. For the amenities, people, and location, Dr. Faye's home was worth every penny to rent for my stay in Denver. "
29855042,477089017,2019-06-27,270796374,Jill,"Nice place to stay. Very spacious for the price. Just watch your first step in the door, there are stairs down almost right at the entrance.  Would recommend."
20949319,212394093,2017-11-17,44453118,Kyle,Wonderful spot! Recently renovated and close to a bunch of great restaurants. Looking forward to our next stay!
30795636,484312057,2019-07-08,271407769,Santosh,Perfect place for a flight layover.
6410804,342913445,2018-10-29,170607800,Mary,Jerry was a great host and very responsive to our needs. The room had all the amenities we needed. The location was nice and quiet although parking was sometimes sparse. All in all a fine experience.
29305639,561570200,2019-11-09,23623211,Victoria,Amazing art work! Wish it had a kitchenette but def worth the price. It was a bit weird hearing Ross above us at night and in the morning.
15094515,114449874,2016-11-18,98475325,Denise,"The stay at the loft was amazing! We loved it! It was in a great, quiet location but close to downtown Denver. Very clean and elegantly presented! I would definitely recommend and come back in the future!"
852934,15934311,2014-07-18,9573418,Shannon,We had a terrific visit and stay here. Amazingly welcoming hosts. My son and I were immediately comfortable and felt at home throughout our stay. We even had the chance to see some of Tom's rare books. What a treat. Definitely a great spot in in University of Denver area!
2467260,152457064,2017-05-16,11500811,Rohit,Ryan is a great host. We had a great time. He was very helpful and constantly tried to ensure we are comfortable. The property itself is in a great location and close to lot of places of interest.
14010321,103008390,2016-09-20,82211646,Cynthia,"We had an amazing time at Herbert's. He gave us a tour of the place and as he was showing us how the TV worked, we noticed that the cable wasn't working.  He wasted no time in coming to our aid, calling his provider and getting it resolved right then and there.  

Throughout our stay, Herbert and his girlfriend Angela were nice and personable, asking if there was anything they could assist with.  They knew we were going to see the Denver Broncos game that Sunday and asked afterwards how the game went. We also greatly appreciated their kindness in allowing my family that lived a few hours away to visit us at the apartment for a few hours on one of the days we stayed there. 

As far as the place itself, it did not disappoint . The bed was so comfortable which made the busy days visiting Denver more relaxing.  We enjoyed the coffee maker as well as the fridge where we put our leftovers each day.  The place was very clean with more clean towels than a hotel room provides.  The bathroom was very spacious and each room had a large mirror which helped since it was four of us getting ready each morning.

It should also be noted that as the apartment description mentions, travel by bus really is easy from where the apartment is located. My husband and I were without a car the first day of our visit and choose to take the bus to and from downtown Denver.  The bus stop was quite close by making it easy for us to be without a car that day.

Overall, we had a great time in Denver and a big part of that was because of our stay at Herbert's.  He took the time at our check out to see how we enjoyed our stay and to ask if there was anything we would recommend. We would definitely recommend others to stay here!"
14612748,455439920,2019-05-19,154446274,Jen,"Amazing place to stay, Highly recommended!! Food & hospitality were out this world along with a great location, it couldn’t have been better. Thank you so much we will be back!!"

He was a fantastically helpful host, too, with lots of useful advice on the local area. If we find ourselves in Denver again we'll be back in a heartbeat!"

9652984,246612416,2018-03-25,83295793,Aaron,I loved this studio apartment and it's location. Capitol Hill is a beautiful older neighborhood. Everything is within walking distance. It has an excellent patio on a vibrant corner.
25549371,334940294,2018-10-10,45897627,Meredith,"We loved our stay at Shelby's place! Check-in was easy, the carriage house was very clean and well stocked with everything needed for our stay. Plus Shelby had excellent recommendations of places to go and things to eat in Denver! Thanks again, Shelby! We can't wait to come back!"

24825329,550355609,2019-10-18,187920625,An Ren,"Michelle’s place is incredibly clean, nicely decorated, literally round the corner from the coffee shop and a pleasant stroll to the convention centre. Highly recommended!!!"
8606580,352006673,2018-11-24,61465429,Trey,Really great place in a great area. A whole family was having Thanksgiving upstairs and we shared the outdoor common space with them. Ending up having a great time with everyone.
16589595,269012415,2018-05-26,14139343,Adam,"Dan and Tiela are total hosting pros. Stayed for an eight hour overnight layover, which is tough to get any sleep in no matter what, but check-in and finding the house are super easy (Uber/Lyft were both difficult and very overpriced apparently because of a concert in town that night, so keep this in mind if you're weighing this or a hotel with airport shuttle), the room is clean and easy to get sleep in, and the bathroom is huge and perfect. Got exactly what I wanted out of my eight hours in DEN - sleep!"
31800521,454663905,2019-05-18,174604493,Katie,"Lovely space with great hosts, highly recommend!"
22231253,251812468,2018-04-08,51011424,Irene,"Dan's place was close to downtown and centrally located to adventures around Denver.  Dan's place is comfortable, clean and reasonably priced.  We were able to save a lot of money by eating most of our breakfasts at the house and packing lunches for our day trips.  When we were there, there was something wrong with the heat, but Dan was able to address the issue.  Dan's website provided some suggestions for things to do and places to see and also the check-in and out procedures."
8427693,189436974,2017-09-01,143591135,Kerstin,Really nice people and a beautiful room.
29282821,362995806,2018-12-27,43825026,Jessica,"Luke’s place is in the best location ever! Close to a bunch of restaurants and cafes and also pretty close to downtown. The condo had a cute little balcony and a dog park right across the street. Although it’s important to mention the dog park is not fully fenced, so if your dog runs off it might not be for you! Otherwise his condo was nice, clean, and perfect for a little trip. Thank you Luke!"
24466118,547689355,2019-10-15,249961994,Juli,"Modern but cozy space, with a small but useful kitchen, comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. 

Spencer was very responsive and had good recommendations for restaurants nearby.

We had a lovely stay!"
4263661,112904147,2016-11-08,60185701,Rashawndra,"Great experience staying here! My original stay didn't turn out as I planned so it being my birthday weekend & first time in Denver, Melissa was able to make my vacation so much better on a short notice. Teddy is the sweetest dog, the house is clean & up to par & cute neighborhood. I will definitely stay here & would recommend this place for others. They have great insight to some places to dine & not far from the downtown area as well. My boyfriend & I enjoyed our stay. Thank you so so much Melissa, John & sweet Teddy for your hospitality!"
6373869,480387315,2019-07-02,165881412,Bibiana,"This place is in a great location and was very clean. Ryan is a great host, and made my partner and I feel quite welcome - would recommend this place, especially for weekend getaways!"

23685442,353806324,2018-11-29,226844986,Robert,Nice efficiency unit with good access to the local Stapleton area. Safe and secure this unit comes with its own two Guard Dogs.
25195731,321618202,2018-09-10,126976685,Andy,Great location and service. Exceeded all expectations.

Julie made the check in / out  ""Easy - Peasy""  - - apartment was completely stocked with essentials PLUS treats - ice cream bars were wunderful after coming out of the mountains -  yeah
My granddaughter and son loved the toys and books -  pool was fine / seldom crowded - - - very nice & friendly neighbors
Great location - very near major thoroughfares - bike / walking trails - health club - public transportation - 30 min from Red Rocks park - 3 golf courses with in 10 minutes - did i say great location - - foodie places every where "

3742687,533486031,2019-09-21,12009019,Anne,"Lucy was a really wonderful, warm and welcoming host. We had some lovely chats with her which made a great start to our USA visit.  She gave excellent instructions to find her place and had lots of information on places to visit in Denver. 
Our room and bed were really very comfortable and we were able to use an extra lounge next to the bedroom. Her home was lovely in a very pleasant neighbourhood. There 
was a very lovely deck outside where we ate. We were able to use her kitchen and dining area. 
Parking was very easy and we were not far from Denver where there was a wonderful Botanic Garden. 
It was a very easy drive from the airport especially when arriving late. We would certainly recommend Lucy’s place."
31503,452215652,2019-05-12,65961181,Lauren,Rick's place was so clean and nice! We enjoyed our stay and the location was a good launch point for so many of our activities!

24179534,340693669,2018-10-24,79724459,Colleen,"Ryan’s place exceeded all expectations. The apartment and complex are even more beautiful than the pictures. The check in process was super easy, and the complex really is super Airbnb friendly! The apartment is so nice, much nicer than the hotel rooms that I have previously stayed in Denver. In addition, the location can’t be beat! It’s literally right across the street from Union Station. I was able to walk to all of my meetings, and dinners. I wish there was an option to give this 5+ stars! I’m definitely wanting to come back to Denver while not on business to stay at Ryan’s place again. For anyone reading this who is hesitant about Airbnb, book this place!!! You won’t regret it, and, like me, won’t want to stay at a hotel in Denver again!"
32408183,469447790,2019-06-14,137728180,Hannah,Beautiful space! Absolutely love the location. Walking distance to everything you could need.
40088850,568746726,2019-11-24,100253044,Nick,"I can't say enough good things about this place. First, the location is AMAZING! Less than a block to Avanti, Brider, Highland Tap & Burger. If you're looking to be in the best spot in the best neighborhood - this is it. And it's just on the edge of downtown.

Next, it was so nicely decorated. I want the owner to decorate my house. Wow. But it was still super cozy and comfortable with all the blankets and couches and warm spaces they created.

Check-in was a breeze, everything was perfect. I only wish we had more time there. 

If you're in Denver with a big group, this is a must stay! I will be staying here again!"
32524249,512736869,2019-08-18,176402817,Muriah,Simple but cozy home for the weekend! Super friendly hosts. Enjoyed my stay!
20568074,213083118,2017-11-19,150463319,Justin,"Wonderful place, right off Colfax so there are plenty of activities very close by. This is a great place to stay if you want to experience all Denver has to offer"
756594,416987768,2019-02-25,239438433,Elyssa,"This place is such a wonderful little gem. Great location! Ling greeted us as we walked in the door to welcome us to the space. The space was adorable! Beds were very comfortable.  Great hospitality such as: allowing us to use their hot tub at our leisure, parking in their driveway to avoid tickets, maps and suggestions of the area,  and homemade scones for breakfast. Everything was well appreciated!!"
18893513,197527653,2017-09-25,80362255,Taylor,Stay was pleasant. Easy part of town to get around. Hosts had a loud dog and were loud themselves on occasion- it was a weekend so that's expected I was just there on business.
27017512,483785494,2019-07-07,260611750,Mark,"Excellent location, great place, loved the rooftop deck in the evenings"
13478248,218914812,2017-12-15,56726884,Steven,"Nice place, right near a park to walk your dog.  garage parking was great, but would not have fit my truck.  it is a downstairs apartment in an old house so it can be noisey if the host is having company."
9770909,438448008,2019-04-16,239636437,Macalen,"This place was great! It’s a beautiful and super modern and clean house. The house was well secured with a security code, and has its own small parking lot, which is super convenient for downtown Denver. It is very close to the heart of Denver, so foot traffic is very high in the neighborhood, but it’s so easy to go shopping, hiking, etc. There was a great coffee place called Amethyst just 5 minutes away and an awesome Jamaican cafe. Super easy stay, thanks again Yousef!"
15746223,535566303,2019-09-24,92174890,Kaylea,Perfect cozy little place with an awesome outside patio! Super friendly host.
21011356,477163732,2019-06-27,83787529,Mary,This place is beautiful and we loved that it was updated but still maintained the historic aspects of the original home. The location was perfect and we enjoyed walking to some local restaurants. We would definitely love to stay here again on our next trip to Denver :)
16065774,248538184,2018-03-31,165222322,Aly,Amazing! Stephanie and Max were more than welcoming and accommodating. Made my time in Denver very enjoyable!
5347637,347745790,2018-11-11,157130952,Trevor,"Greg is a very nice person and always checks in to see if everything is going fine. Just know that you will hear footsteps from up stairs, piano playing occasionally, hear people when they shout, and at the moment the exterior door doesn’t have a blind so you can see bedroom if door is open from outside. I’m sure he will fix that soon because the door was installed when we were there. Other than those things it is a lovely basement. In the description of the place it never mentions a basement. Also the walk to Trader Joe’s is not very close if you have bags of groceries."
1402409,33386701,2015-05-27,10950791,Susan,Great communication with Pamela she was very easy to deal with for this trip.  The house had plenty of room and easy to enjoy.  We have rented plenty of homes in the past and we will definately stay here again.  The home is a few minutes from Downtown and worked out well for us.  Thank you Pamela - We enjoyed our stay. 
36775182,533516753,2019-09-21,290002192,Crystal,This is great for someone on a budget thats a very early riser. The amenities were nice especially the private kitchen and bath. Expect ~$10-15 per lyft/uber to get downtown.
6623325,295588447,2018-07-23,65814340,Eunice,Very quiet room and the beds in our room were super comfy. The shower was more luxurious than most hotels! Being able to help myself to a double shot of espresso in the morning was such a treat. 
2978155,78080781,2016-06-05,27576959,Jacqueline,"Great stay at John's place, on a very pretty street, which is within walking distance to some cool places to eat and drink. And of course Whole Foods! The apartment is really spacious and although we didn't eat there, the kitchen looks fully equipped. John was really communicative before we arrived and it felt like no request would have been too much. Thanks for a great stay John!"
4180622,27652876,2015-03-09,26767267,Jennifer,"We stayed in this modern home for a week while work was being done on our own home less than a mile away.  Our stay was a breeze given the home is outfitted with everything you could possibly need.  The updated space is perfect for two, but we brought our toddler.  The home has a gate at the top of the stairs so he roamed freely which was another relief for us.  

I would highly recommend this space for short or long term stays.  You won't regret the choice. 

"
24828537,266849453,2018-05-20,70579852,Jordan,"This place was brand new and very clean.  The neighborhood looks like there's going to be a lot of new construction like a lot of Denver is.  It's right across from the stadium so if you're going for a football game this will be perfect.  10 min Uber ride to downtown.  Plenty of space for 8 people.  The weather didn't cooperate with us so we didn't get to utilize the rooftop patio, but that seemed like a great place to hang out."
12002460,212631159,2017-11-18,151457912,David,Becky was a great host. Private guest quarters is very nice and separate from main house. Main house has beautiful yard to enjoy. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a quiet comfortable place to stay.
13059132,130114976,2017-02-04,46672541,Jose,it was a great location for exploring plenty of restaurants and centralized to various neighborhoods and downtown
732845,30599922,2015-04-25,26023721,Jessica,"John's house was amazing! Perfect location close to town and not far from Red rocks which is absolutely gorgeous. The house provided everything we needed, the roof tops were I believe the best part besides the master bedroom ( call dibs on the master bedroom now) heated floors in the bathroom , with the most amazing bathtub you can practically swim in! I would defiantly  stay at his home again if we ever travel back to Denver which I can most defiantly see happening soon! "
21080559,293581494,2018-07-20,42045958,Abigail,"Great location and stress-free parking in Brad's driveway in the back is available. We arrived on a hot day and fans were set up in the basement space, ready for us to turn on when we walked in which was appreciated. We had to kill 2 bugs within the first ten minutes of walking in, which dampened the coziness just a bit but it's a basement so some bugs are to be expected! Overall, we were very comfortable in this private and large space for the night. Thanks to Brad. "
861993,3823650,2013-03-18,5304726,Doug,This little space was great for a weekend trip - very close to a lot of fun Denver activities in an old neighborhood. Highly recommended.

29063041,418641074,2019-03-02,222477991,Lauren,"Overall, it was a nice place for the night. I wasn’t crazy about the location, a bit out of the city area and in a weird corner near  a lot of construction. But the place was big, bed and pillows were SUPER comfy. Amenities were nice, though we couldn’t figure out how to use the Apple TV. Loft felt safe, parking and access to building were easy and safe."

11192056,128947168,2017-01-28,76365110,Jasmine,"If Kinga would allow us live in this flat we would move to Colorado in a heartbeat! This place was way more that we could have hoped for. We fell in love with Denver on our trip and Kinga's place was a huge contributing factor. We had so many activities planned but I think our favorite part of the whole trip was getting to lay back, relax and enjoy what this beautiful flat had to offer. Then, when we got hungry, all we had to do was head downstairs for a delicious dinner! We definitely plan on making Kinga's our official spot for future Denver trips :)"
36283276,542774421,2019-10-06,65596495,Cameron,"Great space, close to a lot of things, just as advertised. We had a great stay!"
6348993,168963475,2017-07-10,69272438,Cody,"They are so very nice and accommodating. Room was super clean and they actually made us dinner on our last night. If I'm ever I Colorado again I'm booking them asap. 

House is in a nice neighborhood and the coffee shop across the street is really good. They give you a bunch of complimentary coupons for different place across town also. 

The bed is nice and comfortable and I believe a queen. I'm a big guy and so it was nice to have the space. 

Can't recommend enough. "
11192056,231132021,2018-01-30,52649022,Milena,"Stayed with Kinga few times before and can’t imagine different. She is very welcoming, professional and the place is top notch! A lot of personal, unique touches all over the place. Huge deck for cigarette smokers, comfortable beds and I can go on and on ... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I had not have any issues with the noise and I would stay again. Highly recommended!"
25318621,496569684,2019-07-27,9241942,Rebecca,"Cindy’s place is just as described. Cozy, well appointed with essentials, and just around the corner from many nice shops, restaurants and pubs.

24633836,267744313,2018-05-22,189967443,Krishna,"The studio apartment is in the heart of downtown Denver. A number of activities that we did incl. Capitol Tour, Museums, Coors field, Whiskey tour and the 16th Street Mall were either walking distance or 10 min by car. Just perfect. The apartment has been updated, is quite private and suited our needs perfectly."
27722990,427052470,2019-03-22,139682016,Armando,Tahvory and Billy were amazing hosts! The home was beautiful and very clean. They also were always available for us to contact and offered some amazing suggestions around town. I’d definitely recommend this home to any of my friends.

She was easily reached and everything we needed during our stay was already placed in the basement for our use :) It was cozy, inviting and so clean! We were in and out a lot with a lot of sightseeing AND arrived late with our flight delay, but getting in and out of the home and neighborhood was a breeze! Cute neighborhood close to anything and everything - Portia even includes a list of their recommended places to eat/see while you're in Denver! (The mexican food recommendation was yummy!) We missed Portia during our stay with all of our outings, but got to meet Tracy and she was so kind! Made us feel right at home! We can't wait to visit Denver again and would definitely book again with Portia if it's available! :) Thanks for a wonderful stay! Just perfect!"

Sam's apartment was the perfect home-base for a week's stay. We enjoyed staying here rather than in one room in a hotel. The apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet. The photos give the complete picture. We could walk to our destinations. And Sam was helpful with our one techie question. He also gave us some ideas for our first day in town that were just right.  As I said to Sam, I was ready to move in."
36805939,508916015,2019-08-13,66957165,Ashley,"Ray and Bailey were very communicative and made our stay in Denver very easy. This place looks far on a map compared to popular places but it’s actually perfect because it’s a cheap and quick ride away from just about everything but in a nice quiet location. Any time we had any questions, they were quick to respond. I’d recommend this if you need a place to stay in Denver."

If you talk to Shelley & you have a group that’s larger than the recommended amount, Shelley does her best to accommodate & or you can rent to spot downstairs. We did the latter & WE TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT. The spot was great. It was close to everything. We had la croix and snacks waiting for us. 

The Airbnb made our experience 10/10. It’s close to everything. We were near the heart of everything. 

The rooms are so cute and our group couldn’t have asked for me...I even got compliments for finding an awesome spot like this! "

We absolutely can not wait to stay here again when we visit Denver."
6187302,273012625,2018-06-04,30620899,Andrew,"This is truly a great spot for your stay in Denver. The location is prime, and it's a beautiful and comfortable place. Also, it can't be understated how nice it is to have a garage. Denver is pretty easy to navigate without your own car, but it's great to have the convenience of the garage if you want to get out of town for a day. Again, great place. "
10494162,410758657,2019-02-10,13704442,Amanda,We loved this historic neighborhood-beautiful in a snowstorm.

I loved so many things about Ashlee's place, it was 11 degrees and snowing when we visited and we where able to walk to so many places such as Five Points, breweries, restaurants and shops. 
The place is so gorgeous! Every single detailed had us amazed, the welcoming sign, the welcome basket, the silver wear, the restroom and not to mention how adorable the brick is! We where all imagining how cool it would be to actually live there! 
Thank you so much Ashlee, next time we travel to Denver I will most definitely return to this AirBnB. "

It's honestly a fantastic space, right across the street from a large park (which our pets appreciated immensely), and there are so many thoughtful touches. Robert is both welcoming and easy to communicate with, and his place  is definitely inclusive and well thought out. It's also close enough to downtown Denver that we were able to go out and about easily. Thanks for having us! We'd definitely stay there again!"

-Location is closer to Aurora than Denver, so about 20-30 min drive to most locations in Denver
-Gym is available and equipped with a few cardio and weight machines
-Parking is free and very accessible 
-Bathroom and bedroom linens were dirty or not available for the stay. It seemed they had not been cleaned from a prior guest.
-Bedroom was being used as an office during my stay without notification

I actually woke up from an amazing night of sleep and thought I was in my own bed before I opened my eyes and remembered I was on a work trip. That is how awesome this place is! They also have keyless entry which is a huge plus for me. If you need to stay in Denver, pick this place. I can't recommend it enough. Absolutely 5+ stars in every aspect of scoring. "

All in all, it just depends on what you're looking. Personally, I learned it was not what it was looking for. While it was nice stay, I wouldn't stay again."

18177763,181978110,2017-08-13,109718549,Cheldton,"Just wanted to add to the already positive descriptive reviews. The house looked better in person than in the photos. And it stood out on the block. The living space was comfortable. The house was stocked with things you would have at home. The garage looked small but it did fit our vehicle, a 2017 Chevy Impala. Go right ahead and book. You'll be happy you did."

4014983,23009372,2014-11-20,22290739,Kassie,"Brad and Jenny were so wonderful! We were delayed by almost 3 hours, and they still were willing to make accommodations for us to stay! They even offered us rides before they found out how late we were getting in! They were so gracious and offered advice on things to see and where to go. They had snacks and things already stocked for us to use while we were there and they checked in each day to make sure we didn't need anything. Truthfullly, I wish we would have been there longer to be able to get to know them better! They were so wonderful!"
4817072,36685728,2015-06-30,25229166,Juliana,"Matt and Mandy were super attentive and responsive, the house looked exactly like the pictures and the neighborhood is great. Great shower too!"

12002460,153312923,2017-05-20,34490444,Daliah,"This spot is an absolute gem! Becky and Tre were incredibly hospitable and provided an incredible space for rest, relaxation, and indulgence. Everything inside the unit was top quality, design, and clearly reflects the warmth and care for their guests. The space was beyond a private room, it had a private entrance and enough equipment to have breakfast inside every day. We got around by foot and UBER, with no issues.  Thank you Becky and Tre! "
26281796,554100412,2019-10-25,17249050,Ms. Kyle,"Two overnights in three (Website hidden by Airbnb) stays at Monica and John's could NOT have been any better. Beautifully appointed home and rooms, comfy beds and exceptional linens.  All the right touches for a memorable stay in ""the Mile-High City."" Perfect distance from the airport for a late arrival or early departure...you won't be disappointed! Can't wait for my next visit to DIA and Colorado."

98014,721904,2011-11-15,396041,Suse,"Lindsey and Jim are both awesome hosts. They made me feel incredibly welcome after I landed on their doorstep from the other side of the world and stayed for two weeks. 

The house was lovely, but the best thing was the people, and just how accommodating and lovely Lindsey (in particular) was. I cannot speak highly enough about the experience, and have already recommended that some friends get in contact with her when they have relatives coming to stay. "
13789796,514125083,2019-08-20,9770488,Maria,"The house offers a spacious, minimalist apartment on a lovely street. We all slept well. The beds are comfortable and the sheets are soft. Good location."

Also, the chocolate chip cookies they left were the bomb and the perfect touch after a long day of traveling. Highly recommend!"
30012308,423306670,2019-03-13,74214716,Jason,The space could not have been nicer and more clean! And that’s not even the best part. Due to the weather there was some travel issues and they made amazing accommodations to help us out. We couldn’t recommend this place or these people more! If your looking for a place to stay stop looking here and book it!
30857184,495175891,2019-07-25,35849,Steve,"This was the perfect location for us. We could walk to so many restaurants, parks and stores. We loved walking the neighborhood full of amazing historic houses. Lyft rides to other parts of Denver we sought were short and cheap.  The suite is upstairs and ha every we needed. Glen was so easy to deal with and flexible on a few things to help us out. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or book again."
30819895,475776978,2019-06-24,129164253,Virginia,"The space was comfortable, not small as a previous review stated.  The beds were comfortable and the apartment light and bright.  We will stay again when we visit our daughter in Denver."

19123588,291378176,2018-07-15,11393988,Bryan,"If you can stay at Renee and Ryan’s place, just do it! It’s a great location within walking distance to Avanti, Root Down and so many other places. It’s got a well appointed kitchen, shaded patio /w grill and plenty of space for entertaining.

Though we never asked for anything, Ryan stopped by one morning to make sure we had enough propane for the grill. Next time we’re in Denver, we’ll definitely try to stay here again."
6730800,37201188,2015-07-05,16578377,Caleb,Great house on a cool side of town. The house was clean upon arrival and Nikki was prompt with my questions and met us when we arrived to show us around. The back yard was a really cool spot to hang out. There are a lot of cool stores and bars near the house that were in walking distance. I had a great stay in Denver and would book with Nikki and Rob again. 
665622,228643444,2018-01-20,165076848,Peter,"Becky was AMAZING. Great experience and when I come back I’m definitely staying here again. Clean and easy access, VERY walkable as titled.

18023988,250056972,2018-04-03,172943915,Erik,"Awesome hospitality! Especially the RAD poster coming from a retired BMX kid who wouldn’t want to stay in a home with a RAD poster? 
Everything was great from our check in to our good bye was just great! Felt like I never left home also very close to everything and I mean everything in Denver. Very quiet neighborhood as well and our host were very welcoming with their home. I will book again in the future!"

13764044,484343199,2019-07-08,185522385,Tommie,Our stay with Maria and Scott was great! The location is in the beautiful Cherry Creek area near many fantastic restaurants. our accommodations while close to the action were private and secluded and allowed us a place to relax. My bed was so comfortable I wish I could've slept in more. I would highly recommend this Air B&B to anyone.
10343072,105375603,2016-10-01,77308816,Keith,"House was perfect.  Check in/out was super easy, location was excellent, house was very clean and nice. Had a great time and I highly recommend this place to anyone!"

21735478,532932831,2019-09-20,2496697,Daniel,"Classy and clean, small bedroom in a beautiful old house. Secure home and room, comfortable bed with quality bed linens, tasteful decorations. I’m something of a light sleeper, but the shared bath didn’t bother me too much. I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend for anyone who wants to stay near downtown Denver."
23063850,239913536,2018-03-03,172671281,Derrick,"Great space within walking distance of delicious restaurants and nice shops. It is directly across the street from city park, zoo and minutes from downtown. Also private and very clean."
24605701,290593089,2018-07-14,15157167,Meghan,"This home was absolutely perfect for my boyfriend and I, we had such a nice time! All the details we’re perfect, and we felt right at home. I didn’t want to leave !"
22727793,336694042,2018-10-14,65363718,Haley,"Great, inexpensive place to stay."
8954951,217112211,2017-12-07,3541629,My An,Ena's home was lovely and very welcoming. We felt right at home when we arrived. It was very clean and we knew where to find everything we needed immediately.  She was responsive and check in and check out was very easy. We were only there for one night but it was a good start to our trip.
14962389,445049042,2019-04-28,212362428,Josh,Great place for a trip to Denver with all that you could want and more.

4817072,79171640,2016-06-11,47226967,Monique,This home was perfectly located to everything we needed and wanted to do. Matt and Mandy were available via text whenever we needed them. We absolutely loved the private backyard with all the sitting options and shade. There was a Natural Grocers that we were surprised to find a very short bike ride away and we almost drove about 20 mins to find a Whole Foods! On the down side the house was a little warm due to no central a/c but with everything else going well we managed. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely rent again. Thanks Matt and Mandy!!
19435120,206048572,2017-10-23,57920278,Stefanie,We really loved the spot and location. It was perfect for our romantic getaway.
11602011,104201524,2016-09-25,85360645,Stephany,Melanie was a great host. She really did her best to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. My boyfriend and I ended up enjoying the surrounding area more than the downtown tourist central. Everything you need is near by. The space is very clean and well put together. I would definitely recommend to a friend.    
7663335,156456273,2017-05-30,10630321,Brett,"John's apartment was the perfect place for our week in Colorado! The parking space was a real bonus, as we had a rental car and the spot is right next to the entrance of the apartment building. The space was lovely, full of amenities and thoughtful touches. John was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. Lots of restaurants in walking distance and a grocery store literally across the street. We loved exploring nearby towns from this urban home base. "
24520787,416956011,2019-02-25,175864769,Jordan,"Very nice place, blocks from some amazing brewery's and restaurants"
8941796,112903977,2016-11-08,3418018,Susan,"Chris met us at the front door and introduced us to her Carriage house.  Very tidy and minimalist...just what we needed after a long day on the road.  Bathroom was spectacular, as was the heating system.  Comfy and cozy and close to everything.  Darling neighborhood...lots of pretty old houses and easy parking."
25549940,425616676,2019-03-18,5665479,Joshua And Emily,"A great space and location for trips to downtown Denver! Apartment was very clean and very nice! Onsite parking is a HUGE plus!

1792152,69177081,2016-04-09,5230557,Randal,"Rita was great, easy to communicate with and a gracious host. The room was just as described. The neighborhood is nice and Rita has plenty of great recommendations for whatever your interests are. "

29906744,490467767,2019-07-18,276721248,Nick,"Simple space, cool people, and just a short drive from most things in Denver. Could've been a little bit tidier and it was in need of some housekeeping, but the place seemed full when I got there so who knows. If you need somewhere to keep your stuff at during the day and a bed to lay your head at night, this place is mostly for just that."
32640061,438042970,2019-04-15,64328667,Lori,We loved our stay with Ellen!  Charming home in convenient location. Our family of 7 - ages 14 and up were very comfortable here. Will definitely stay again when back in Denver. Ellen was quick to respond to questions and extremely attentive needs.

23974947,350567072,2018-11-19,224727499,Amy,"This was our first time at an Airbnb and really had a great experience. Very clean and comfortable. Beth is a great, accommodating host. Would stay here again!"
25614605,296000337,2018-07-24,30980927,Danielle,"Zack’s location is perfect if you’re flying out of DEN. My boyfriend and I had a very short, 3 day extensive trip to Colorado so we were coming and going at odd hours. Zack was very accommodating and we definitely recommend staying with him and his awesome kitty!"
16861201,523915597,2019-09-04,6503391,Frank,"An enjoyable space with an outstanding host. From the small touches (a light left on for late arrivals, fresh fruit, sparkling clean everything) to the exceptionally responsive host, this is a great place to stay. It's close to downtown but you're in a quiet neighborhood (away from the loud crowd).  There's even a lovely park across the street.

Gabriela was extremely responsive to the little challenges we had (I couldn't figure out the TV, for example), and every communication was light, cheerful, and helpful.

The space itself is private and quiet. Because you're in a basement (with windows, by the way), outside noises are minimal. The host resides upstairs, but you really aren't aware they are there. Only an occasional quiet bump will remind you that you are sharing a home.  The laundry is a plus as well.  

If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing base of operations for your next trip to Denver, this is it!"
13172589,479889700,2019-07-01,257243045,Sydney,"Super cute place and a great location, close to everything! Jasper was very a friendly doggo and Kim was a great host!"
16925673,318505027,2018-09-03,82570674,Camille,Great place and good value!
23325732,266908154,2018-05-20,109892088,Lucy,Alejandra and her husband were great hosts! They had great recommendations for dinner and made us feel comfortable in their home. The homemade breakfast and cute little pup were an added bonus!
13414484,506490647,2019-08-10,13045190,Amy,"This was an amazing place to stay! My brief stay didn’t allow me to take advantage of all of the amenities, but I appreciated them all.  It is a really beautiful and tastefully-appointed private suite with access to home’s kitchen.
The bed was ultra-comfortable.  A wonderfully-walkable neighborhood- dining, drinking, cafe-ing options, as well as a beautiful park nearby. Communication was great and they let me leave my bag there before the place was ready."
14488549,328625481,2018-09-26,198915930,Jennifer,"This space is great for anyone looking to be in the center of it all. With being just off of the 16th Street Mall everything was within walking distance: food, shopping, bars, etc. Public transit is just outside the front door, or, if you have a vehicle like we did, there are a few different options for parking for about $20/day, give or take - which I feel like is reasonable for the location. The space itself is stylish and feels spacious, with the high, exposed brick walls and interesting art pieces. Check-in was a breeze and I felt secure coming and going from the loft. The building is older, and as such, you can hear people above and around you, but it didn't really bother us as it was pretty much within waking hours anyway. Overall it was perfect for our few days in Denver and if I find my way back, I would definitely look up Alexandre to stay with again!"
236207,19932149,2014-09-21,15358829,Cherie,"Dave was a very welcoming host, all the way through from enquiring about the unit to past the end of our stay - he went above and beyond and we really appreciated his hospitality. His travel tips turned out to be great and enhanced our trip around Colorado.
Everything at the Penthouse was as advertised and was clean, comfortable, convenient, competitively priced and well equipped. Although we found the views from the apartment interesting, they weren't ""awesome"" until the last night when we were treated to a fabulous fireworks display from the stadium - that was pretty awesome!
The only negative comment we have about the Penthouse (and probably easily enough fixed) was the very noisy washing machine - we were worried the machine was going to jump out of the cupboard. "
13204273,321926417,2018-09-11,177411610,Ricardo,"Tim runs an awesome place! Clean and spacious, it made my stay in Denver enjoyable. Great communication and local recommendations. The keypad give flexibility when coming and going, and the pups are super cool. Will definitely stay here again."
14369542,178497407,2017-08-05,134873258,Angela,Super air bnb! Located near airport. Fun neighborhood with a great park and the Beer Garden was a good time. House so nice with the most precious pup ever...Ella!!! You'll be glad you picked this place!!

Also loved that each of the three bedrooms (one per floor) had its own bathroom. Cristina was great to communicate with and responded immediately to any questions we had. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
9770909,442135502,2019-04-22,237275986,Nicole,Yousef has a wonderful home in a great area. We enjoyed walking to various breweries and food places near by but also enjoyed making a breakfast in the kitchen. It was a wonderful trip. We hope to visit again soon!

19018085,296809428,2018-07-26,169361918,Jerimi,"Kristen’s place was very clean and spacious. My mother and I appreciate how we had a private bathroom and the basement pretty much to ourselves (with the exception of when Kristen needed to use the laundry — but that was not an issue at all). Also, Kristen had a pull out bed in the Ping Pong room that allowed my mom and I to sleep well. 

Also, I’d lie to note that she still allowed us to check in around 5am (when our original check in was supposed to be by 11pm) due to a big flight delay hours prior. 

Thank you for giving my mom a wonderful first-time AirBnB experience! "
34257400,482584813,2019-07-06,30013833,Samantha,"Very clean, homey & welcoming place to stay. The neighborhood feels very safe, there are a lot of nice historical homes surrounding this one. You can definitely tell it's a historical home, the setup of the house is peculiar, but there was plenty of room for the 5 of us who stayed. We'll go back if the chance allows!"

21563426,258717214,2018-04-29,11657702,Margaret,"Small older artsy home in formerly working class Denver hood just across the i25 freeway from downtown. Short bus ride to Lodo but not so nice a walk due to freeway underpass. Tony has a flair for unusual decor - funky in a good way. Guest room has everything one needs, comfortable bed, reading lamp, water jug., quiet. Tony is available and caring in a genuine way. His dog Buddy is very well behaved."

He promptly addressed any issues we had. The thoughtful amenities provided are endless! Things we didn’t realize we forgot to pack until we found them provided already. His home is very clean and cozy. The neighborhood is very convenient to downtown and within walking distance of a lot of neat places. We would definitely stay here again when we’re back in town to visit family!"
12972487,263690140,2018-05-12,185950190,Alexandra,If you are visiting in the Denver area you have to stay here. Tonya is an amazing host and she makes the best cookies! This location is in walking distance to public transit and close to where ever you plan to go.

Laney was very quick to respond to any questions we had. The house  came with everything you could need to make you feel at home during your stay. Definitely one of my favorite Airbnb's I've stayed in Denver.
575758,18699032,2014-08-30,2177586,J.D.,"The place was great! Kerry was really helpful. I was a last minute booking without a lot of reviews, but he took a chance and let me stay. We didn't spend a huge amount of time in the loft, but the time we spent was great. Cool place, cool neighborhood, great shower. All was wonderful. I'll be staying here again on my next trip to Denver. "

They give you full privacy and have a spot to park your car directly next to the guest house. Everything was very clean and organized. Comfortable bed, perfect little kitchen and bathroom for two people. Awesome area (neighborhood) to stay in that is close to everything in dt Denver.  We would easily stay here again, and recommend giving the dog pets. She's so sweet! "

The location is in a friendly neighborhood near the Zoo but quite close to downtown and Colfax. Ruth really thinks of everything--there were muffins on Saturday, fridge with milk, yogurt, and water, and dishes for snacks. The bed is comfy, and it's dark and cool. I slept like a baby! I especially enjoyed working on the back patio with a cup of tea. Truly a great stay."

I stayed with her for several days, and she was welcoming and super flexible, letting another bridesmaid in a pinch stay with me one night. She was so easy to communicate with (despite my phone breaking halfway through my stay, I think we covered everything), and the room was as advertised."

Anyone who wants to stay in a great neighborhood with easy access to all Denver has to offer, this is your place. Ben was available if we needed him, via text through Airbnb with quick responses.

(i.e. toiletries galore) It was very easy to access and we loved getting greeted by their dog, Capone! Four girls traveling jsut with backpacks had a lot of stuff to unload, but the place was clean enough to feel comfortable laying stuff out. We locked ourselves out one day and Brett was right there to let us in! Definitely would recommend this stay."

Bathroom is stylish with a nice dual-hand held showerhead.  Bedroom is carpet floors (home is hardwoods, bathroom is tile). Overall good stay, LaMark was quick to respond when I e-mailed him on the day of check in. No key to your bedroom i.e. couldn't lock it when I was away."

19413652,188222324,2017-08-28,127597195,Janna,"Taylor seemed like a very friendly person; however we were disappointed with our stay given what we paid.  The house was kind of  messy - dishes in the sink, bad food in fridge, and pretty strong odors from what I assume was the litter box for the cat. The listing indicates you have access to kitchen, living and common areas but the living room is secluded off with curtains and messy as well so we did not feel welcome to that area.   The amenities are also bare minimum - the a/c was never on during our entire stay (85+ degree weather), no hand towels in the bathroom, no toilet paper for a day and only 2 super flat pillows for a couple. His pets are friendly but the dog woke us up several times early in the morning by barking for 15+ minutes. I feel bad writing this review because  Taylor seemed like a very nice person and even accommodated  a pretty late checkout for us on our last day; however the experience was not worth what we paid.  I will say the place is located in a fun, unique artsy neighborhood that we enjoyed a lot though."

You stay in the basement of the home with a private entrance from backyard. Space has a good sized dinette-like area but no kitchen sink to fill water or wash dishes. Mini fridge was stocked with water bottles, which was convenient! Large enough for family of 4. Wall mounted TV across from sectional was a great hang out space. Floors are a bit squeaky, but otherwise a good stay!"

It's only a 10 dollar Uber ride into the city, and if your driving to any other city in Colorado it is very close to the interstate.  The check-in and check-out process was very simple and Dyami was quick to respond to any additional questions we had. Our space in the home was very clean and secluded from the rest of the house being in the basement. We had our own private bathroom with towels and toiletries such as body wash and shampoo included. My friends and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommend!"

21946032,284494908,2018-07-01,26767600,Kerry,We traveled to Denver for our annual girls trip.  It was our first time there.  We loved every bit of our stay!  The house is walking distance to some great local spots.  It is also a very short Uber ride away from downtown.  We decided not to rent a car for this trip and it was by far the right choice!  Natalie was easy to communicate with and we adored their home!  Would highly recommend.
4978830,324718923,2018-09-17,68730328,Wanda,"The house was perfect for a family wedding that we were attending. The location was great for the wedding venue and the other pre-wedding activities. My sister and I, along with children/granddaughters had room to “stretch out” and amentities of home. Thank you for making our first Air Bnb experience very positive! There are not enough stars to rate our hostess, who was waiting for us upon arrival,  and very inviting/informative. Definitely would recommend and return in the future!"
6471872,352830246,2018-11-25,75477652,Ivette,"Megan was a kind host who stayed in contact with us throughout our stay. Her home was clean and spacious and my family enjoyed cooking Thanksgiving dinner her in the wonderful kitchen! The beds were comfy, amenities were great, and the location is fantastic. Although it is only street parking, we never had any trouble finding parking for two vehicles.  My two nieces also enjoyed the trampoline  and kid friendly feel in the basement. Thanks, Megan for hosting our family!"

15116690,141554827,2017-04-03,40236374,Francesca,"Stop! Don't look any further! DaNelle's house is the (Website hidden by Airbnb) FOR a very reasonable price ! The house is so clean and beautiful (she has taken her time decorating the house and painting the walls all sorts of colors), the room is even better. With its own bathroom you get all the privacy. She made sure to leave all sorts of goodies for us all around the room and it made us feel so special. My boyfriend and I went for a weekend getaway and honestly we felt like we couldn't have stayed in a better place. DaNelle has amazing positive vibes, gives you all the privacy and access to her kitchen and home. Thank you so much for an unforgettable stay!"

665622,2614861,2012-10-15,3464740,Louie,"Becky was great!  She was extremely flexible, accommodating and communicative, and her place was perfect all for the activities that we were doing downtown.  It is located a great little quaint yet modern little neighborhood that is just a 15 minute walk to downtown.

The place itself is very clean, open and comfortable and has every convenience that a home could possibly need except a T.V. although we did not miss a T.V.  The neighborhood has lots of really nice and unique cafes, coffee shops, restaraunts, stores and shops; in fact, the neighborhood is known to have some of the best restaurants in Denver

if you are looking for a nice place to stay and you don't have to be in the heart of downtown.  I strongly recommend Becky's place!"

The room (and the apartment as well) was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Rita was a great host giving us som hints about what to do in Denver and how to get to downtown etc. Rita’s dogs were very cute and we also enjoyed our time with them as well! :-)

There was nothing we could think of that could improve. We will definitely stay with Rita again if we return to Denver!

3992779,98170393,2016-08-29,26846981,Gayla,"Our stay with Elizabeth went very smoothly. She was quick to respond and offered wonderful advise for things to do in Denver before we even arrived. On our arrival 2 beers and coffee were waiting for us. The actual space was nice as well. There is a kitchenette if you want to cook, a comfortable bed, a sitting area with a couch and a small but functional bathroom. We were very happy with our stay and would gladly stay again. Thank you Elizabeth! "

The neighborhood is really beautiful and the community seems to put on lots of fun events. In the weekend we stayed there, they held a concert and a farmers market within a five minute walk from the house. Great place, definitely recommend!"

31262420,550174215,2019-10-18,302378152,Heather,"This was our first time trying a bnb, so we weren't sure what to expect. Traveling with our family, we were looking for a more homey, comfortable setting. After reading the reviews and seeing this was a kid-friendly place, we thought we'd give it a try. It was perfect! The owners are upstairs, but you can barely hear them. Definitely way better than a hotel where there's often loud voices in the halls, slamming doors, hearing everything through the walls, etc.!  

There were lots of cute personal touches that made the trip even more special for my family (e.g., a personalized punny Halloween sign). It was also super convenient to have a full kitchen with lots of supplies, especially with little ones with bottomless pits for stomachs. Of further note is the master bed which was like sleeping on a cloud, to the point where I came home and now resent my own bed LOL

The location is great! Only minutes from the park, gardens, and zoo as well as downtown if you also want to go do fun stuff... or have to do boring work stuff ;0)

Overall, super pleased with our first experience! Our kids are already asking to go back :0)"
13752452,486437843,2019-07-12,34781877,Heather,"Exactly as described with some extra added conveniences like tea, coffee, and lovely backyard sitting area. Can't beat the location. Jamie responded to every request promptly and was extremely helpful."
21516952,441118134,2019-04-21,357706,Deanna,"Lisa’s place is great! She has a charming, cozy room ready for you with a very comfy bed. The location was great, just a few minutes to lots of action. We enjoyed the Where the Wild Things Are theme and hope to visit again next time we come through. We highly recommend a stay at Lisa’s place."

25841700,448074775,2019-05-04,10249495,Julia,"Chalise's home was perfect for our family of 4.  It was amazingly clean and just as described. She was a wonderful host with thoughtful touches throughout - like tips for the neighborhood, pack n' play, well appointed kitchen, games, kid toys etc. We travel frequently to Denver and will be back! Highly recommend."
13656664,252939950,2018-04-12,15973104,Nina,"The hosts were great and very communicative and it was a wonderful location (easy access to downtown). One thing I will note is that this unit is not separate from the house above, aside from a heavy curtain, so noice travels easily from upstairs to downstairs, and I’m guessing vice versa. As a woman who travels alone, this was a little unsettling and I don’t feel that it’s communicated as well as it could be in the listing. The shower is also borderline luke warm, something I wouldn’t have mentioned in the public review however I noticed that it had been mentioned in previous reviews and just wasn’t addressed. I was in and out of town for a quick business trip, so by no means were the accommodations unkempt - just not what I had expected."
6913874,113658503,2016-11-13,53195848,Maggie,"Valerie and Shelan's place was awesome and just like in the photos. Valerie is super nice and helpful with things to do and places to see in and around the Denver area, she even recommended places for yoga and barre classes close by and when she saw me heading to the Rocky Mountains with only a light jacket on she let me borrow her own personal jacket and gloves for the hike. I loved staying here and it was definitely a  home away from home and I plan on coming back in March and staying again. Thank you so much for the hospitality. :)"

29858733,414060871,2019-02-18,128777923,Nancy,It’s on the lower level and you can hear everything that is going on upstairs. Other than that host communicates with you very well.

17175148,292317515,2018-07-17,55674033,Louise,"I would highly recommend this Home. We stayed two nights with our grown up daughters and explored Larimer and went to Morrison at Red Rocks. There we had a great lunch at a Bistro at the start of town. 
This home has any amenity you could ask for and is in a great location. The beds are very comfy, it’s very artsy and cool inside and they have a nice Weber grill which we prepared a surf and turf type dinner from Denver Market, which is a must if you love good food. We played games and listened to their collection of CDs and had a blast. No problem with parking as they have a private parking slot in the back as well as plenty of available street parking. 
Check in was a breeze as Kat is a great communicator - within 10 minutes every time. You can’t go wrong in this place!  Also, the cute little front porch is a must if you like to relax and chat with the locals. "
22209112,236563444,2018-02-19,105610066,Leah Kay,"We had a quick stay of only one night but James property was a very clean, modern & exceeding our expectations.

25342433,562402016,2019-11-10,214345192,Simone,"The space was a little smaller than I was expecting and it would not be easily accessible to those with mobility limitations but that's really the only negative I have to say. It was a cute cozy space, perfect for my needs since I was mostly only there at night. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable! I slept very well. The best part about this place is the location. I was able to walk or take a short bus ride to pretty much any place I wanted to go. Ingrid was a very considerate and attentive host! I definitely reccomend this place."

It was easy to follow instructions on getting in the building and having a garage to park my car was very convenient for my stay. Definitely would stay again!

The front and back porch had such a relaxing ambience that we spent more time outside than inside!  During the day, we enjoyed coffee, reading, yoga and just some down time in the hammock. At night, we listened to music and had a cookout with the really cool lighting as a bonus. I love that there was a great library of books to choose from!  It was obvious we were made to feel right at home! The kitchen had everything needed for all meals. We appreciated the technology available for listening to music and WiFi for internet use. Getting in and out of the house was a simple process. We had a great time walking to Washington Park for a family morning outing! The grocery store and Starbucks were just blocks away. The house was very clean, the neighbors were pleasant and to top it off, the weather was glorious! Jared was a great communicator thru the whole experience! We highly recommend this precious home for any type of family coming to visit Denver!"

833937,355585934,2018-12-04,189957087,Katie,This home is exactly as described. It’s super cozy and in a great location. Eliza is a remarkable hostess and is incredibly prompt in response if needed. It is very family friendly (my kids loved the piano). It is across the street from a school that has a playground you can use after school hours and on weekends.  The neighborhood is very quiet and very close to any and all activities in Denver. This place feels like home. Definitely recommend.
29187078,358256762,2018-12-13,78505036,Christopher,"Rachel’s place is nice, cozy, and quiet. Everything was clean and she communicated well. The home is only a few minutes from downtown, and looking west on 1st st, there is a great view of the mountains! The only downside is that the surrounding neighborhood is a bit less appealing. Other than that though, I liked the place! It was a good value and a comfortable place to rest."
14010321,341020645,2018-10-25,4834261,Aslan,"Herbert’s place was fantastic. It’s private, modern, and clean. Great price for 2 bedrooms too!"

15551405,157857713,2017-06-04,130504413,Jaclyn,"Perfect location for walking distance to great dispensaries. Room and board was a perfect fit for me. Quite area but if wanting to go downtown it was a 20 minute drive ($16 uber)
I would highly recommend it!"

25084283,309106983,2018-08-17,95927822,Honore,"A versatile and fun stay. As a family of 5 with three kids ages 5 and under, finding the right fit is a challenge. This was great. I’ll start with the host, Jessica was so helpful and responded immediately. She was even willing to come right over when my five year old almost locked us out. She left lots of great suggestions and some extra treats. The home is very clean with nice cook-wear, soft sheets and good pillows. It’s a historic house with beautiful stained glass but it is also well updated. The location was great as it was close to downtown for my husbands business meetings but walking distance to a couple small parks and lots of trendy yet family-friendly places to eat. We loved the aquarium just a couple miles away. The zoo wasn’t too far either and Jessica said the children’s museum was great although we weren’t there long enough to check it out. Traveling with kids is always a challenge so I greatly appreciate the extra hand I get from awesome hosts like Jessica. "

31039806,414119003,2019-02-18,53445422,Samantha,"Quaint place with few amenities, but you don't need many because of how close you are to the breweries, food, and art! Great place to stay for a weekend visit. The wifi wasn't the best in the bedroom but worked fine in the living room area, so if you are in town for business you can do it in the living room. Good host and the space had everything we needed while we visited."
22515364,346162264,2018-11-07,221364269,Molly,Amazing and Beautiful!  Better than the pictures!  So warm and comfy and chic!  Great location and great eatieries within walking distance!  We had such a nice time unwinding and resting here.  Very private and quiet!  Well worth it!  Thanks Stephen!

She is extremely attentive and delightful company. Her very roomy and tastefully decorated condo is located in a beautiful part of Denver, walking distance to some great cafes and restaurants. Would absolutely want to stay there again on any future trip to Denver!"
25459427,414151201,2019-02-18,70414273,Emily,"The Lafayette House is a great spot to stay if you are planning on keeping busy during your time in Denver and just need a place to sleep. The room was located right by the front door so it is easy to come and go and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The location is hard to beat - within walking distance to so many coffee shops, breweries, and restaurants and quick access to major highways. Definitely would stay here again."

The flat was really lovely-well decorated, clean (spotless) and great location. Very good value for money considering other properties in denver are pricey.

We recommend it highly!

24159249,311675039,2018-08-21,198471699,Simon,Jeffrey's place was super clean and the place was perfect. We were able to grill and hang out on the private patio. It was truly the perfect place for 8 people. The location was not far from the night life and downtown Denver. We hiked three different mountains and went to a hot spring that were either an hour to two hours away. Seriously recommend this place and Erik is the best!!
15174189,162858825,2017-06-22,46109738,Kelsie,"Pam's place is in a great location. We only stayed one night, but it was a perfect place to explore a little and rest. Room is very clean, the mini fridge is convenient, and the private balcony is a nice place to relax. My boyfriend had a bit of trouble getting comfortable in the bed, but I thought it was fine. This was our first experience staying in an air bnb with the host and it was an excellent experience. Her animals are very sweet and although Pam wasn't around much, I wouldn't have minded it as she was a joyful host. Would definitely book this place again!"
10401469,112798848,2016-11-07,84684411,Sabrina,The room is just as it is the picture. It's nice and spacious! Todd lives in the perfect spot. You can walk to anything and he allowed us to fully use the kitchen it helped a lot! He was super friendly and recommend this place.

17175955,322625918,2018-09-13,65139944,Allie,"I absolutely LOVED staying at this charming cottage. Susan (Steven's wife) met me a check in, walked me through the house and showed me all of the special touches - special coffee, light settings, keypad, etc. The cottage was beyond cute, clean and spacy. Great location - easy to get to University or downtown. Susan also provided a lot of local recommendations. Can not say enough good things about staying here! Ps- super comfy beds."

4052272,279471559,2018-06-20,77183376,Patti,The basement apartment is very cute.  And as pictured.  This was  first time I've stayed with a family living above the rented space and it was just as enjoyable as staying alone.  We rarely heard noise and the dog is very friendly.

21422875,256831403,2018-04-23,176476402,Aisha,Michelle's place was a really nice clean quiet and friendly place to stay that was close to downtown and basically right in the middle of everything. She was really good at responding and helping with any of our needs!! Her place is also 420 friendly which was a plus since my friends and I are heavy smoker so the back yard and front porch was perfect!!
21697851,506537986,2019-08-10,224889210,Jenny,Cool place in a nice neighborhood. No complaints at all.

The backyard is perfect for nice quite meals and you feel as if you have the place to yourself.  I would 100% recommend staying here to anyone looking for a quite comfy neighborhood.

Check in was a breeze, the place was quiet, tidy, and in such a convenient location. I pretty much walked everywhere from LoHi to Downtown throughout my entire stay ( approx. 15-20min walk, 5-8min uber ride).  Met David on my last day at his place, he is a very friendly host with solid feedback and suggestions on things to do in area. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who's seeking to explore Denver."

31153209,555603530,2019-10-27,157203337,Laura,"Polina and her partner were very friendly. We felt right at home in a warm comfy room. The only thing was getting use to sharing the space with the host. It was not as private as some other rooms. Great location, close to breakfast and restuarants. Easy check in, just make sure you're on the correct side of the building, apt 13 is under ground level. Wifi worked. And nice local suggestions on what to do. Would highly recommend for a visit stay."
35028964,481976735,2019-07-05,41420810,Sarah,"This place was everything I wanted and more. Jamie has an amazing place right in the heart of downtown Denver. Close to a Whole Foods, CVS, King Soopers, and about a half of a dozen eateries makes this place ideal for eat in meals, or a night out on the town. This location is about 2 blocks from union station (the train from the aitport) so it made getting from the airport to ""home"" a breeze. Great view from the large shared deck, and if you like people watching then look out the bedroom window for a fun time. This place was a perfect size for me, but I could easily see this as great place for a couple (not much more than that). Great kitchen with lots to cook with, or if you are looking for a night out on the town, then Jamie left me with some solid recommendations.  Location felt super secure with a night time guard, 24 concierge, and floor specific access. Will definately come back to Jamie's home again!"
31859537,483638743,2019-07-07,243048510,Lisa,"This home was perfect for our large group! It's located in a great area near many shops, restaurants, and parks. The house is open, spacious and bright! We would stay again if ever back in the Denver area."

17607361,218439501,2017-12-12,157988936,Craig,"My friend and I stayed at Liz’s place for 4 nights and it was everything we could’ve asked for and more! 

Liz was cool enough to invite us out for a night on the town with her friends and we even ended up going to the same concert another night! She felt more like a friend than anything and we really appreciated her kindness and hospitality. 

The surrounding area is really cool and we enjoyed walking to Bardos every morning for our coffee fix. Also, the private parking spot in the back with separate entrance was super convenient. 

Oh yeah and the mattress was amazing, too. 

10/10 would rent again!"

There is a great coffee shop right in the building and a beautiful view of downtown Denver. We were very pleasantly surprised. If you’re traveling with a baby (as we were) there is a pack and play included so you don’t have to bring it. The condo was great for kids. Even the balcony is safe.  We found the owners to be really responsive and the instructions were all clear and easy to follow. A great stay."

34019010,507628635,2019-08-11,214742131,Bethany,Mary was a wonderful host! She left us a bunch of options for snacks and breakfast. She communicated very well with us and the beds were super comfy! There is no AC but it was cool enough to open windows and she left us with plenty of fans so it wasn’t a problem for us :)
20914531,317882243,2018-09-02,75767895,Marie,Really worked with our check in time. Communicated fast. Easy stay with everything that you could need. Parking was no problem.
18778248,194952006,2017-09-17,67773368,Todd,Very quiet room with a comfortable bed.  Only frustration was we couldn't get the TV in the room to work.  Not sure if that was my fault or if the cable box wasn't working.  I'd stay at Kimberly's again.
9273796,70552306,2016-04-18,45867792,Dana,"I had an amazing stay with Bridget and Josh. They were friendly, welcoming, and made me feel at home while leaving me you to my privacy. I had access to the kitchen and the laundry room which I really appreciated. The space I had downstairs felt like an entire apartment. It has a spacious living room with a Netflix equipped TV, a newly renovated bathroom, and a cozy bedroom with a really comfy bed. I appreciated them accommodating me at the last minute, and I will absolutely stay with them again when in Denver. Thanks for a great stay!"

We’ll definitely come back!!!

21029294,228618803,2018-01-20,28431646,Kim,"I answered the question how much better was this than we expected with only 'a bit better' because we got so much good information before we came that we  were clear what to expect and it was great. It's in a perfect location to walk through great neighborhoods and it was quiet, which is even more important to us when we're sleeping away from home.  We were gone most of every day but the bed was comfortable (another 'must have' away from home) and it was all very clean and up to date.  We'll be heading back anytime we stay in Denver.  We're so lucky that we have opportunities like this rather than staying in big hotels."

The host responded to all my questions very quickly and was hospitable with her replys. While we were there it was snowing, so we very much enjoyed sitting around the fireplace and drinking tea/coffee!  Look forward to possible staying here again!"
13467564,367394611,2019-01-04,95157837,Isabella,We had a wonderful stay! Only thing is if you are a light sleeper you might get woken up often due to walking above you. Other then that we couldn’t complain about anything!
6854536,282894079,2018-06-28,46564282,Brandi,"Perri’s is exactly as it was described in the summary. Perfect location with quick access to the freeway. The house was clean and very charming. Their two furry babies were shy the first day, but quickly warmed up to us and made the stay even more welcoming. 
I highly recommend this property."

The hosts graciously left things for us to use in the house (all amenities of course, but also food, a working BBQ, bathroom toiletries, etc.), which made our stay very easy.  There was air conditioning, which was a relief for the hot days.
We enjoyed sitting around the large dining table, or outside in the back area to enjoy the evenings.  It was such a pleasant setting, we were thrilled to stay there during our trip to Denver!"

6869896,125055181,2017-01-03,71530408,Asia,"Ok, this is long but I know this will help you make a decision whether or not to stay.... 

It was an absolutely amazing stay.  Location was PERFECTO!! Right next to City Park, Denver Museum or Nature and Science, golf course, Denver Zoo (if you like that).  Billy was so great in making sure we had everything we needed to get in properly. When we got in, we were a little confused when the lights were on in the house, but it's probably because I told Billy we'd be heading there at night. On the counter, he left a ton of fruit leathers, granola bars and pita chips for us and the kitchen was stocked with water, too!  

Every room in the house was amazing. Is it just me or was the floor heated?  The shower was fantastic and just the right pressure, heated up really fast. The bedroom was perfect and so comfortable.  We used the additional room for our suitcase and belongings. The living room was so inviting with beautiful light fixtures. Believe it or not, but I was more excited to be on the couch at our ""home"" rather than being outside at a bar on NYE!! We watched movies and played a ton on backgammon.  We found some really comfy blankets to just hang out in.  It was the best experience ever! We used every amenity in the house except the kitchen (didn't cook) and the washer/dryer (should've washed clothes hehe).  We even figured out how to access the garage! So much easier than trying to find parking on the street. 

When we were ready to go out for a bite to eat, Billy provided us with a rather large list of categorized options!! What!?!? So awesome. I felt right at home. "
5229866,80003904,2016-06-15,2524340,Richard,"Daniel was a great and friendly host, and his place was equally great for my business trip. While not downtown, his place was located close to major roads/highways (so getting to most paces around Denver by car was pretty easy). His place can easily accommodate a couple, and the living room has a sofa bed (so two people and/or up to two couples could squeeze in too). Washer and dryer in the accommodation, which was great for a multi-day business trip. Would book with Daniel again if available!"
22231253,252917239,2018-04-12,180817439,Geremy,Great place to stay very close to down town. Very clean and nice. Felt just like home and would stay her again in a heartbeat.  Dan was very helpful and giving great tips on things to do

33907546,547171571,2019-10-14,25058090,Wendy,"This place was actually nicer than we had expected. Everything was squeaky clean, the bed was comfortable, it has a convenient ensuite bathroom and the sun room was lovely - a great place to relax that made a spacious ""bonus room."" 

It's located in a tidy neighborhood just a couple of minutes off I-70, so it's very central and there are some good restaurants nearby, too. 

We also liked the table and chairs set up in the backyard, where we could watch the squirrels scamper around. 

Josh was a great host - very accommodating and communication was excellent. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others."
747085,3738954,2013-03-10,5014278,Tyler,Krista really goes above and beyond the call of duty to make sure her guests feel welcome and taken care of. The property is great and the amenities un-matched. Great experience!
1189999,6305990,2013-08-07,7094387,Cora,"Mike's place is a wonderful place to stay. We were surprised by the amount of space, indeed Spacious, such large bedrooms, wonderful. Mike was very friendly. When something needed attention he came straight away. We also liked the file with all the information about the house and about the surroundings. There were even maps of Denver in it. A very good idea. I personally liked the garden a lot. I enjoyed sitting there and relax. 
It is a wonderful place. Why go to an hotel when you can stay in such a beautiful place with so much room. Very much recommended."
29130386,485404171,2019-07-10,266023441,Colleen,"Very cool space located in their backyard! AC worked great, bed was  comfy, and the place was very clean!"

3115132,33252619,2015-05-26,23835182,Maurizio,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Kate's place for about 5 days and we absolutely loved it. As first time visitors to Denver, we couldn't have had a better experience anywhere else in the city. Sunnyside is a cool neighborhood, with many restaurants, bars, and cafes within walking distance and just a short drive away from downtown. Kate was super nice, responsive, and hospitable throughout our stay. What you see here is exactly what you get: a cool, clean trendy condo. I highly recommend this place for solo travelers or couples. Lastly, like many other guests, the highlight of our stay was Kate's friendly cat, Selma, who certainly made our visit to Denver a memorable one. "
13172589,454194640,2019-05-17,214498222,Ute,Kim was very welcoming and I loved meeting her dogs! Her place is pretty close to downtown. I would definitively stay at Kim’s again!
22770241,408185667,2019-02-03,16467081,Megan,"We loved Chris’s place and especially the Lohi neighborhood. It was super fun to explore and we felt immediately comfortable and welcome in the area. Couldn’t recommend this place more to people visiting Denver and wanting a local experience! 

Tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance, and super close to downtown. Also! We did Downtown Denver’s Best Walking with Austin (found via Airbnb Experiences) and highly recommend for out of towners."
15807058,234082413,2018-02-11,38006070,Katia,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at Amanda's place. It was beautiful, the access code made the trip so much easier because we didn't have to worry about keys, and it was the perfect size for us! Also in a great location =)"
3541671,354968339,2018-12-02,67950175,Krishna,Great location. Good hosts. Cute dog.
15509056,400600680,2019-01-12,40534382,Michael,"This place is an excellent value for the money.  Jerry was extremely quick to communicate and was nice enough to leave some laminated pages with recommendations - nice touch.  This place is small, so don’t expect to fit more than 1 or two very close friends or significant others.  Place was clean and I would definitely stay again.  Thank you."
12068403,191466236,2017-09-07,2244762,Kristie,"Great little place to stay! Close to everything. Loved the style of the place.

833937,151983100,2017-05-14,112939093,Aaron,"Cool little 2br house with a couch and air mattress.  It was tidy, orderly and interesting. The instructions were straight forward and the house was accessible with a security code on the doors. The turntable was fun (my friends and myself are big music geeks), and the art on the walls sparked some great conversations. The neighborhood is about 1.5 or so miles from Downtown, which is a quick Uber or a 25 minute walk. There are a few abandoned houses here and there but you can tell that the 'hood is being cleaned up. Do note that the house is across from an elementary school but we didn't spend much time out front. The back door opens to a little enclosed yard. There's a gate to an alley with off-street parking for two cars. Check out Rosenberg's Bagels! A coffee shop called Purple Door is a quarter block away and most amenities are within a few blocks. I didn't take my children but I would say that this place is child friendly, so long as your kids aren't too curious. There's a lot of knickknacks to play with around the house. Leaving relics and unused ingredients or surprises for other folks is obviously encouraged. We had a blast and I would absolutely stay here again. "
23669031,305101008,2018-08-10,202978096,Tom,"Place was great! Jason and Jordan were very responsive with any questions and our one week stay was hassle free. 
Five stars here! Awesome place(: "

It’s nice to have access to both kitchen and laundry. Frank was also a great host- he had a lot of excellent suggestions for places to visit during my stay. His home is the perfect home base for a Denver vacation - I would definitely stay again!

25327520,366511077,2019-01-02,41103568,Jeff,"Tomiko's place is a cozy retreat smack in the middle of all the action in downtown Denver. It's convenient to trains and buses as well as being a short walk to good restaurants, cafes, and bars. The 16th Street Mall is a block away with lots of options for entertainment and shopping. If you want to spend more time enjoying what Denver has to offer and less time tied up in traffic, this place is for you!"

Her home is charming and the location is perfect with a few blocks from a beautiful morning walk in the park. My favorite grocery stores were under 3 miles. To my surprise BeatBox doughnuts, a delicious must try was a few blocks from Samantha's home! We had a wonderful time. The neighborhood was adorable, quiet and in the heart of Denver. "
14369542,434864170,2019-04-08,51442899,Ryan,"Super nice and clean place! Close to all kinds of restaurants, stores, and a park. Jenn, Jay, and their 2 kids were all very friendly and hospitable to me and my puppy. Would definitely recommend staying!"

16844845,188797365,2017-08-30,17852485,Marissa,"Todd's place was awesome! It looks just like the photos, if not better. It had all the amenities we needed during our 4 night stay. The bed is super cozy (it's a bit firm but we liked it!) and enjoyed being able to walk to where we had to go around the immediate area. 

Todd is very responsive and helpful. At one point we had an issue with opening/locking the door using the keypad, and he tried it out and provided a video on how to successfully use it.  

We could periodically hear the door open/close and footsteps upstairs since we are technically in the basement, but it was not disruptive or prolonged (and to be expected when sharing a home).  "
12276698,515296267,2019-08-22,46724335,Erik,Vincent’s place is just minutes (about 5) away from down town Denver. I stayed here for business so the location was perfect. I’m also a big runner and the house is only 2 blocks away from the Cherry Creek running trail . The two upstairs bedrooms both have a master bathroom attached which was great. It was quiet at night and an overall good experience.

I even recommended this place to my parents and friends to stay when they come visit me!

Can’t recommend staying here enough!"

Great restaurants and shops right up the street. Easy access to Ubers and scooters to get downtown (5 min ride). They literally thought of everything in the suite, from extra phone chargers to qtips in the bathroom. The design is so cute too with books and art and board games to play. I would highly recommend staying here on your trip to Denver."

A really nice park is about 5 minutes away. The park has a lake and 2.5 mile path around the lake. Great for walking or running.
I felt very comfortable using the kitchen. They gave me plenty of room, in the refrigerator.
Overall, I'd give them and my exp!erience an A+"

A little tight on space for 6 people but location was perfect as it was close to everything that we ended up doing for the 6 days that we were there for. The place was clean and very homey. It does get a bit warm in the summer considering there is only fans and one portable AC unit but otherwise I recommend this place to anyone looking to make some memories in denver!

Air mattress had a hole in it, futon is lumpy and the bed upstairs has wooden slats underneath that fall out if you roll around. 
He asked us to stay off the front patio which is really the only place to sit around the location which was a bit confusing 
After one of the games one of his neighbours drunkenly walked into his place looking for him twice. 
Overall perfect location for baseball with ample food and beverage stops around"

The hosts responded to questions immediately and were incredibly accommodating. The space is excellent, especially for the price. There are plenty of beds, and everything you need for a short stay. The beds were comfortable, the space was clean and smelled nice, and it was even better than advertised. There’s a lot of privacy and you do not hear the hosts upstairs. The bathroom was clean and well equipped, in fact, I don’t know that I could suggest an improvement. Thank you!"

We really enjoyed staying in a “tiny house” for our first time, and even though it’s small it’s perfect for a traveler and has everything you could need, and also has an amazing bathroom and very comfy bed.

The place was super clean, very comfortable and private. The location was convenient to downtown and the hosts had a book with dining recommendations that were right on. We did this last minute but the response time was super quick and the check in seemless. We met Mike with his beautiful dogs one evening & he was very friendly, as were the dogs.We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this place!"

Snacks and basic breakfast was provided, such a nice touch. Location was perfect for our trip and meeting up with friends who lived close by. Only downfalls include difficulty finding location initially and difficulty knowing which spot was okay to park in. Gretchen was helpful in helping us decipher it. The apartment also gets very warm with no way to adjust the heating as it comes from Angie’s house into the apartment. We opened windows which helped but left is either too warm or too cold. Lastly this place is not handicap accessible. We walked through the backyard often which includes stepping over a large whole and gutter drain, however you are able to enter through the gate in the front. Overall, wonderful stay and ending up being a great location for us to visit Denver! We would stay again-"

Close walk to all the action in Rhino,  Downtown and Coors Stadium was a 1/2 mile from the front door.   I walked everywhere.  I didn't need the car rental.  The place was fully stocked with home amenities and a local beer on tap!  True.   Great communication, clean and easy.  I used the grill on the deck and was able to enjoy the place like I was home.  Thank you Casey/Kaitlyn.  Great spot. Well worth the stay."

Great location -convenient, walking distance to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, Voodoo donut, and a short drive to downtown.

Neighborhood is up and coming.  A bit funky, we had no problems, and felt safe. We loved being close to downtown, the interstate, and the light rail.  We didn’t move our car once. 

Super breakfast supplies, eggs, granola bars, oatmeal, bananas, OJ, English muffins, spread for muffins, American Cheese.  Bring your own coffee grounds and creamer.  King Sooper is very close if you need anything 

Only concern was it was a bit stuffy in one of the bedrooms. There are tabletop fans. We could at times hear the people on the wood floors above us. Never late and never early."

The home itself was immaculate. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was extremely clean, and it was quiet. We enjoyed starting the morning with our coffee on the back patio in the perfectly manicured yard. Daniel, our host, was gracious enough to let us leave our bags on site so we could walk around and enjoy the day in the city before official check-in. He also allowed us to leave our bags until our departure flight in the afternoon. We would highly recommend this location to friends and we'll for sure be back!"

Alex provided many details of entertainment, dining and local festivities that were happening during our stay.  He kept in contact to assure we were comfortable and taken care of.  When the air conditioning was not working, he contacted a repair company to assure it was fixed so when we arrived back in the evening the house was cool!!  The Victorian home is well maintained and we felt VERY at home using all the space including the front porch swing and the back patio!"

Great hosts -- very fast responses and very friendly.  There was a weird buzzing noise we heard inside (eventually realized it was from outside) and both hosts helped us quickly navigate possibilities to get it turned off.  

Really cool loft space - would definitely try to stay again!"

She provided me w. suggestions for what to see in my one day visit to Denver, and offered mw wine / tea / etc. as we sat talking the evening I was there. The room was private, the bed comfortable, and she has 2 friendly cats. In the A.M. she offered some delicious and healthy    breakfast items, and I enjoyed relaxing in her outdoor and indoor living spaces. I highly recommend Juliet, and hope to see her again! - Jeanne"

22399469,300246099,2018-08-01,76555705,Jessica,"I was in Denver for five days with my two best friends for a girls trip. We felt so comfortable in Elena and Nico’s home. Almost everything is about a 20 minute drive away, which makes it easy to see a lot in a short time. Getting inside and parking at the bnb was very easy. The home was clean with many amenities including a washing machine, dryer, dish washer, fridge, microwave, coffee pot, huge master bedroom, three bathrooms, and a large deep tub! My friends and I had a great time in the home and would definitely stay here again. Nico and Elena were also very kind and easily accessible during our stay. Thank you both so much for a wonderful trip! 

Just a note to older guests: this home is three stories and does require use of stairs. "
15583685,351715823,2018-11-23,52372925,Nabeel,Great location near downtown. Great amenities and the snacks and water were a nice touch. Keypad access was very convenient. The place is very nicely furnished and was great for my dog.

I didn't read the owners description through where the stairs were mentioned, 3 flights was a little challenging, paired with the lessened oxygen at higher altitude. :-) That's on me though, and I made it work!"

11241369,344099288,2018-11-02,182981082,Shiara,"The space was perfect. Four bedrooms with comfortable beds & enough space. The furnace went out right before my stay & she responded back with space heater in every room. Couldn’t even tell the furnace wasn’t working. & the next morning she sent people out to fix it. Very accommodating. Communication was great, she kept checking in with us. If you are going to Denver this is the place! Not only is the place beautiful the host is great."
28617385,442135825,2019-04-22,235016782,Ashlee,Great location next to downtown that is walking distance to so many cool restaurants and bars.

23812513,426625519,2019-03-21,149702869,Ava,"Location is ok, it is the same  as what is described
Having a private bathroom  is an advantage of her place 
Having access to kitchen lets you make your own meal
The entrance door is on the upstairs so if you have heavy luggages, it can be challenging to carry them downstairs
 Utilitiy (heater) really  needs to be improved so you feel warm enough in that room
Having a heater in that room may be more efficient so you do not feel cold"
16855990,293138344,2018-07-19,76387646,Eric,"great place, as expected. "
665622,155212293,2017-05-27,105519356,Leela,"Great location, easy to take an Uber or Lyft right downtown. The place itself was clean and nicely decorated. We had everything we need and felt right at home. We also appreciated the ease of check-in and good communication."

We were able to check in early and the space was more than what we expected! She even had the small items that you may need for your stay like toothbrushes, shavers, etc. Also, everything was super clean. Thank you for hosting us!"
24015212,275749965,2018-06-11,25468280,Allison,"PERFECT Denver location! We enjoyed daily morning jogs around Washington Park, followed by delicious coffee from Wash Perk, which we enjoyed from the front porch, overlooking the quiet tree and flower lined street. Close to University of Denver and there was plenty of room to spare with just 6 of us. A wonderful place to just relax with family and friends. Parking was super easy too!

Sandy was easy to communicate with, quick to respond to questions, and was very accommodating of our group, despite a few changes in travel plans. She has a real knack for cozy decorating and even left us some wine and breakfast goodies! How thoughtful!!! She made us feel right at home, and now my parents want to return the favor and host her! Thank you for an amazing experience! We will definitely be back!!"
15282172,126397640,2017-01-11,92885627,Marika,"Flying into Colorado, our flight was delayed 8 hours, our rental car was given away, and arrived near midnight. Thankfully American Airlines extended our stay by one day, Emily was very accommodating to this situation. She helped me extend my stay at her lovely private carriage house. My boyfriend and I had the best vacation we've ever had, and this was my first air bnb experience. The house is spacious, clean, and warm! She also provides a variety of coffee and teas which helped because I ended up getting sick from the cold! Also included is shampoo, conditioner, body wash, towels, a blow dryer, a ton of kitchen utensils and cookware, laundry detergent etc! Thank you Emily, we will definitely be back to Colorado and hopefully staying here!! "
14759489,158842870,2017-06-08,124073751,Caleb,Darren was a fantastic host. Great guy with an even better attitude. The living area was good and very clean. Could only eat on the first floor which would honestly be my only negative other than any noise from the kitchen being easily heard from downstairs but if you don't mind being near the city then this place is great. 
81540,19126018,2014-09-07,11666783,Erin,"This was our first Airbnb stay and it was perfect! Jess' place was so cozy and clean, we really felt at home here.  We only stayed 2 nights, but we had all the amenities needed, plus more.  I loved that we were able to bring our dogs and the yard was fenced in.  We will definitely try to stay here again if we are back in Denver; it is a great home away from home in a friendly neighborhood!"
4862881,550929382,2019-10-19,178399506,Liane,"Renaes place was located next to multiple bus stops that made it easy to get around and explore the city! It was also a short walk away to Broadway St. which had multiple fun shops and restaurants. The apartment was also very beautiful and she added thoughtful touches, but the bed wasn’t very sturdy and moved around quite a bit and had to be fixed each morning."
25001622,292727067,2018-07-18,199928754,Jamie,"We would definitely recommend this location for a couple or solo traveller in Denver. The apartment is centrally located, clean and well stocked with basic supplies.  Though small, the space is well utilized. There is a small outdoor garden area which we enjoyed. Taylor was a helpful and available host while affording us plenty of privacy. Great stay over all."

17316601,522225997,2019-09-01,220429373,Amelia,"The location was the best part about this space. It was within walking distance to Broadway street, which had a lot of great shops and restaurants."
27848759,477112881,2019-06-27,245652088,Taylor,The perfect place to stay if you're going to red rocks like we did. Great hiking and concert there and this was only about a 20 minute drive from there. Grocery store with a Starbucks and lots of yummy restaurants right down the street. We had such a fun trip! This is an adorable little neighborhood and the house is super clean and cute and stocked with everything you could need and more. I highly recommend it!
14371267,192945977,2017-09-11,136246444,Jacquie,"Shelley was amazing.  The location of the house was perfect.  Shelley suggested great places to eat and we pretty much took her up on all of them.  If we were to travel back to Denver her place would be our number one.  Great location, close to downtown, and also close to the mountain areas too.  We were able to do a lot from her location.  The room was perfection, private, and clean.  Great great place!"
17638962,203854842,2017-10-15,27426784,Sheena,"Good communication. There were 5 of us who were in for a conference at the Convention Center. Easy Lyft ride... nice 25-minute walk when weather permitting. Had enough space for the 5 of us. The pull-out sofa bed was very springy and not the most comfortable. Could do with more sheets/blankets, but other than that great amenities and location!"
4817072,47618135,2015-09-21,26317254,Will,"Home was just how we thought it would be if not better.  Location is great, with lots to do and easy to get downtown or on the interstate and out of town!  "

Didn't have an opportunity to meet Kim, but Bobby was friendly, and I was in and out at all times of the day and night without any issues! Highly recommend, and an easy 20 minute walk or quicker scoot to downtown!"

13751109,295991453,2018-07-24,80696679,Todd,"Tracy's place was outstanding for my wife and I. The location is perfect to walk to neighborhood restaurants and bars and to get downtown (for example, Union Station).  The photos, while nice, understate the apartment. It is a wonderful apartment with quality furniture; the bed is amazingly comfortable.  We cannot recommend Tracy's place highly enough."
18963379,453034069,2019-05-14,247730391,Dylan,Amazing stay! Highly recommend! Thank you for everything. It was outstanding.
35518196,495232401,2019-07-25,215291608,Ashley,"Justin contacted me the day of our stay with instructions for check in which was great. Close to the airport, key pad front door for late night arrivals. It was clean and as described. Our only issues were that the bed is terribly uncomfortable (very hard and thin) and only two very thin pillows were provided. 
It was accommodating for what we needed and we never actually meet Justin due to late arrival and early departure."
915016,266798084,2018-05-20,45758349,Alisha,Tim and Cindy's space was perfect for us. It was clean and in a very central location. The shower was amazing and the bed was super comfortable. We would stay here again!
1733052,99428375,2016-09-04,41935914,Tami,"The Basement Suite was so nice. As beautiful as the pictures. The bed was comfortable and there were things like extra toiletries, blow dryer, curling iron. We had all we needed and extras. 

Through the entire process, Jason answered all of my questions. I felt like I was being a bother but he was always patient and kind. He even remembered months later that it was our anniversary.  

Jason and his wife were out of town when we were to arrive, so they had a friend taking care of things. She was equally kind and helpful. Making sure things were as they should be. We appreciated the fact that Jason had thought to pick someone who wanted to make sure our time was good and all of our needs were met. 

We would definitely try to stay here again if we come to the area again. Thank you so much for your kindness and a beautiful place to stay."
12986223,487152810,2019-07-13,173418660,Harmon,"Great place to stay for getting around Denver. Just beware that if you unfamiliar with duplexes this could present problems for you! We are from Texas and duplexes are extremely rare, so just take the “Private” description with a grain of salt."
15743145,120942063,2016-12-12,102539699,Alex,Dan was  very accommodating and responsive. The apartment had great value. We would gladly stay there again.
23378643,559786953,2019-11-04,276551795,Matt,This will absolutely be on the top of my list for my return to Denver. Great location and an incredibly well put together home. Having a spot to park was also convenient. Very roomy and comfortable. Zero complaints.
6883917,246062015,2018-03-24,11570621,Colleen,Relaxed and comfortable environment to stay in. Easy to get downtown avoiding freeways.
14842171,344483708,2018-11-03,216589243,Evan,"Michele provided a very cute place for our weekend getaway.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and had a great feel to it.  I would highly recommend and will probably stay again when I visit Denver in the future!!"
21007311,446116925,2019-04-30,117047035,Edwar,Great home! Awesome communication! The hospitality and home exceeded expectation. Great place and hosts. A+
8965601,168956311,2017-07-10,33777666,Emily,Tom's place was beautiful - 3 stories really makes you feel like you and your guests have nice separate spaces. Modern and well decorated with 3 bathrooms. Rooftop deck was a nice treat as well! Ideal location in New safe residential neighborhood but very close to anywhere you want to visit in Denver. Tom was incredibly prepared for our visit - sending me all of the pre-visit check in details and checking in on us from time to time to ensure we had everything we needed (even when he was on vacation enjoying a wedding!!) and his neighbor was on point to assist with any questions as well. Highly recommend Toms place for short or longer term visits. Cheers! 
21120569,520621146,2019-08-30,76475474,Lina,"This place was clean, cute, and had lots of thoughtful touches which I enjoyed. It was perfect for my 1 day break after hiking before I flew back home. One thing, the guest room is connected to the main house by a thin wall (and a locked door). As a results it's not very sound proof for both sides, especially for the dogs."
11336016,462043176,2019-06-01,58194284,MacKenzie,"Awesome deck w/a great view of the Capitol Building, very clean apartment. Really unique and vintage building!"

The room is private with a sitting room and bathroom and it was spotless and cute. Small fridge and tv in sitting room. Great bath with shampoo and necessities. Very clean!! Would highly recommend!! Loved decor"

31491603,492752167,2019-07-21,72769369,Jessica,"Naya was a great host- very communicative and helpful. Her location is a quick uber ride to just about anywhere which is great. The only thing I wish I would have double checked is that there is no central air in the listing (my fault for not looking!) so do keep that in mind. Naya was gracious enough to bring us fans during the July heat wave which we greatly appreciated!!

Thank you, Naya!"
24043228,347628118,2018-11-11,116304126,Dayna,"Awesome location, walking distance to everything you need. Place was very clean. Great shower. It is tiny (as a carriage house is expected to be) but laid out so well that you have enough room. Comfy bed and pillows. We would go back again."

8800911,153609327,2017-05-21,114044522,Alan,"This is one of the most unique places; grand tall ceilings and open-floor plan. There's amazing natural lighting and the space really adds a communal aspect to the experience. Some high school friends and I met up for a long weekend and found that this space perfectly fit our needs. It's within walking distance of great breweries and restaurants. The only (slight) negatives were that despite the hosts providing sleep masks, it's difficult to sleep in due to the amount of light streaming in. That being said, the natural light was one of our favorite parts about this. The bathrooms, shower, and large tub were all favorites of the group. Also, the hosts provided great communication, which is always key to a successful stay. I would stay again in a heartbeat; this place is perfect for groups. Our Uber driver even worshiped in the church before it was converted, so you know it's legit. "
25290541,558238324,2019-11-02,189373589,Sarah,Beautiful home with lots of space that was close to everything!

They had great suggestions for dinner spots and breweries as well. This home was so clean and modern I honestly want my house to look just like it someday. The space was so relaxing to be in and their was great attention to detail. I would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
32662157,431340646,2019-03-31,135746565,Laura,"Selfishly - I want to say ""Don't stay here, it's awful"" so that I can keep this little spot all to myself, but I just can't do it!

The location, the condo, the beds, everything - were just perfect for our overnight in Denver to celebrate a birthday.  The condo is stylish and roomy, the beds are super comfortable and everything we needed was there and available.  We were thrilled with our stay, and we will absolutely book with Abi again when we next plan to visit Denver!

Sooo - all of you looking for a place - STAY AWAY.. so that when we want to go to Denver again, we can scoop up this amazing location/condo/host again. LOL"

We have no problem getting anywhere in the city. 

Pat’s home was cozy and welcoming. Whether we spent the whole day out shopping/ hiking or spent the afternoon inside relaxing and watching TV, this space met our needs. If and when we revisit Denver, we would gladly stay at Pat’s home again!"

23467833,459717824,2019-05-27,44120231,Linda,"Pamela was a great host and the location was central to many activities in Denver.  The three bedrooms and their beds were very comfortable, quiet and private. There were two well-equipped bathrooms (one on each floor).  Breakfast food (cereal, yogurt, milk, tea, coffee, variety of breads) was provided, most exceptionally, fresh organic eggs from Pamela's free ranging, sweet hens in her yard.  The kitchen and dining room were well equipped and large.  Plenty of space to make and eat family meals. The living room and upstairs common TV/lounge room had comfy seating and were stylishly decorated.  A variety of teas and coffees (as well as beer and wine for discounted rates) were available on both floors. The house was across the street from the beautiful Denver Botanical Gardens, which had a delicious cafe for lunch and munchies, and a beautiful gift store. Pamela provided a free pass, which saved our family the entrance fees.  Parking was on the street.  Pamela was friendly and easily available and responded immediately to any questions we had.   We were highly appreciative of our stay!"

18002228,200784854,2017-10-06,38003750,Henrique,We enjoyed our stay during GABF. Centrally located and easy to find. Easy access in and out as well as parking behind which tough to find in Denver. Good food and drink options an easy walk away. Nicely decorated. Christina was quick to answer any questions we had. We would definitely recommend this place.
13171401,80925249,2016-06-20,76479504,Courtney,"I had a lovely stay with these hosts. This was my first Airbnb and I will definitely be using the service again after this experience. The Jonse's house is well located in Denver. It is easy to find, there's ample street parking, the great restaurants nearby, and downtown is just a few miles away. They are close to public transit. Their house is lovely, it is comfortable, and they are warm considerate hosts. The guest room was large and comfortable, and the guest shower puts my own home shower to shame. I could not have been more comfortable or happy with my selection."
31520049,547264992,2019-10-14,289757022,Samuel,"Very stylish and comfortable, also in a great location!"
590,336422,2011-06-26,737867,Janet,My sister and I were looking for a room in Denver (way too late) the night before our arrival and heard of airbnb through another family member. Unsure of how this all works and hesitant to book without some assurance we could be accomodated at such as late date I sent Jill a message and was happy to receive a quick response. We booked and were happy with the comfortable room and gracious host. It was a short visit and was perfect for our stay.
22704110,340027523,2018-10-22,216625705,Essa,This place was really cozy. The neighbors were really nice and the area was so close to everything we needed. Darya was very quick to reply and super nice about everything. The bed was super comfortable and the couch was comfortable for all three of us to sit on or lay on. I would recommend this place if you want to relax with your friends. It is really close to a lot of things too. Next time I come to Denver I will definitely look into Darya’s place.
15093485,551921316,2019-10-20,28251717,Danilo,You will not regret booking this place. I am stunned at how amazing it was.
35762577,512936460,2019-08-18,179858134,Chris,We had a great stay! The cottage is very cute and cozy and Katy was super helpful and friendly. Absolutely recommended :)
8860548,450978629,2019-05-10,64086200,Stephen,"The apartment is spotlessly clean and in a great location in Denver's Capitol Hill area, with much of the city centre within walking distance. In case it's important (and it wasn't to me), the apartment's decor is not modern. But the apartment is great value compared to other Denver listings for such an excellent, central location. Nice restaurants are very nearby as well. In short, it was perfect for me and I would very happily stay here again."
21355645,229629530,2018-01-24,25279864,Tasha,"Hugh was extremely welcoming, and even though I was only there for a short time, he made me feel at home. And of course Humphrey was a delight. "
13041992,116672960,2016-12-02,101295885,Amber,"The room was very comfortable with many charming elements; exposed brick, an enormous clawfoot tub, large glass shower and beautiful views of the downtown skyline.  In addition to that, Jack really went out of his way to be hospitable.  He was there to welcome me and answer my questions about the neighborhood which is just adjacent to downtown (5 min).  The room had a Keurig coffee maker, a stocked complimentary mini-fridge, and great wifi.  I'm in Denver frequently for work and I've stayed at many of the 4 star hotels downtown.  I will definitely choose Jack's place over those for my next visit."
27631494,492695136,2019-07-21,22827167,Thom,Great location. Wonderful two bedroom apartment. Easy check in. Everything was seamless and easy. I would stay here again.
6488535,58618251,2016-01-03,2595909,Alyson,"Brandon's apartment is very comfortable and modern with smart design that maximizes the space and is both beautifully & thoughtfully decorated to allow for as much natural light as possible. Highlights are the exposed brick, modern appliances, upgrades to the bathroom, nice shower, and sleek decor. It was the perfect place for us to ring in the New Year! Brandon was such a thoughtful and responsive host; he welcomed us with a personal note & local treats, provided detailed check-in instructions, his personal guidebook full of excellent recommendations within walking distance (Denver Biscuit Co. was everything!) and was quick to text back when we had a question on parking. The location is incredibly convenient to downtown, several great eateries and hang out spots, while nicely tucked in to a charming neighborhood. We highly recommend a stay at Brandon's!"
17699020,155216330,2017-05-27,53100894,Ayesha,Everything was perfectly clean and comfortable! Amanda is an attentive and responsive host who will make your experience in Denver a positive one. 
28393012,551911263,2019-10-20,34135729,Randall,"I had a great stay here.  The LoHi neighborhood has some nice restaurants and coffee shops and other attractions.  There's even a yoga studio in the building.  It's about a 20 minute walk to downtown (or a very quick Lyft or Uber).  It felt very safe to walk around at night.  The apartment is very cool and stylish, and  the bed was super comfortable.  The whole place is really roomy, with a nice couch and reading chair and a decent desk to work at.  The wifi worked very well.  The building is very nice, and everyone I encountered in the elevator was very nice.   I would definitely stay here again."
21623221,361849981,2018-12-24,780079,Gina,"Our family (toddlers included) all crashed at George’s place for the holidays. The place was small but perfect. I would have loved for there to have been one more bathroom for our party of 8, but we made do. For those with toddlers, the stairs are super steep but the place is well stocked with anything you might ever need. It even had a swanky new washer/dryer! We had a very comfortable stay."
8941796,536395175,2019-09-26,73972871,Ashly,All in all for the price this was a good find. Close to where we wanted to be and had all of the things we needed for a 1 night stay.

24778264,464047590,2019-06-04,133436720,Anna,The host was quick with responses and  communication. The place was very accessible and a great location for exploring Denver especially the rino area. Also very easy street parking. Would recommend!
7238579,92752808,2016-08-09,68420749,Jessie,"April was an amazing host! We felt like friends right away! Her home was very cozy, clean and welcoming. And she was extremely thoughtful; giving us travel toiletries, coffee every morning, helping us find directions to places, even setting up a surprise breakfast for us on her beautiful back patio! I would highly recommend her place, it was a great deal and she was there whenever we needed her. Her and her daughter made us feel right at home! 
It's a 10 minute drive to downtown which is nice, but not the most bike able route to downtown if that's something you're looking to do while visiting the city. I'd recommend taking a cab when staying. 
Overall, a great place and we will look her up again the next time we are in Denver!!"
25324403,280643860,2018-06-23,100943385,John Paul,"Bret was an excellent host! He was extremely accommodating, friendly, and respectful of our privacy. The bedroom was very comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. Both were newly renovated. I would highly recommend this room to any solo travelers or couples in need of a comfortable place to crash."
22305207,535558422,2019-09-24,293131405,Tami,"This is a very clean and well designed home. The distribution and size of the rooms allowed for just the right amount of space for privacy and togetherness. We had  5 adults, but could have comfortably had many more.

The patio and gas fire pit provided a great place to relax and socialize. 

The front porch provide a quiet respite. 

Everything was so well organized and labeled in the house. It was easy to find everything. 

Great choice!"
31168983,522999004,2019-09-02,12771678,Daniel,"We loved staying here. Clean, cute, with off street parking. Easy access to highways and close proximity to RiNo district and Larimer. Amanda had a lot of great recommendations. Lockbox check in. Comfy beds. Good water pressure in shower. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Denver."
34526761,507438561,2019-08-11,167432369,Mariah,"Lawrence and Lance were both outstanding host. They gave us recommendations which were all awesome.

32808646,492929682,2019-07-21,1445252,Brad,"First and foremost, our stay was a disappointment before we ever arrived. Tara and John left me a threatening voicemail and 5 text messages 4 hours before my reservation started when my group was 3 hours away white water rafting. They stated that there were noise complaints from the neighbors and we will be fined $1000 and the police will be contacted. Clearly there was confusion with another guest since we were 3 hours from town. John eventually called me to apologize but it was mostly about excuses since it said I was the active guest. I understand mistakes can be made, but even if I was staying there and causing an issue -- an inquiry into the situation would be a more appropriate way to open the conversation. It made my whole group of old friends super uncomfortable before we ever got there. Tara tried to state there were no guests the night before.

Once we arrived - it was obvious someone did throw a party the night before. There were ping pong balls on the back deck from beer pong. Hair all over the downstairs shower - disgusting! A ton of laundry in both of the dryers. The smell of alcohol. 

It seems pretty obvious that Tara and John flipped the property and put in some basic furniture and art work to make some money. It doesn't feel homey or authentic, and the hosts certainly don't make it feel welcoming. They never followed up to ensure our group was okay. It was difficult to figure out parking. For $1,388 for 1 night for 10 guys this was a terrible deal. I hope they learn from this experience and others have a better stay."
1911814,27295331,2015-03-01,9210775,Susan,"I arrived in Denver just before a blizzard and mostly it was snowy the whole week I stayed at Randall and Dana's apartment. I was very happy to have the clean, pleasant, and well equipped space and Randall kept the stairway shoveled. They were more than helpful, just about instantly answering any questions. The location worked well for me, just around the corner from the 38 bus. The kitchen was great and so was the shower. It all looks like the pictures, except roomier. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a place for 1 or 2. "
11037671,134725782,2017-02-28,81714728,Monica,Everything was as pictured.   Everything you need is close. Public transportation is available.  Jack left everything well stocked. 
20920175,491719528,2019-07-20,186921006,Shannette,Was a really nice place to stay. Loved how they had a little snack out for you because when I got there from the airport I was starving. So that held me over till I got something to eat. One thing that would’ve been soo nice though is they had drinks in the fridge for you you but it was mostly soda. I don’t drink soda so it would’ve been nice to have like even a water in there. The bus stop is literally right by the house which was nice. Which meant I didn’t have to walk far and wait. Check in was super easy. If there is two people going to stay here I would say the bed is kinda small. It was fine for me since I went alone. Other than that it was a nice stay.
4236002,226423983,2018-01-10,8204948,Samantha,"Our stay in the Carriage House was perfect. The space is comfortable, clean, and very private. We cooked meals in the evening and had everything we needed. The coffee provided was also a wonderful bonus! The neighborhood was quiet and close driving distance to many restaurants and shops. Tyler was very helpful and check in and out was easy. I’ll definitely be staying again!"
33254257,537416607,2019-09-28,267461169,Adam,"We stayed a little less than a week, and Katie was very helpful working with us on checking in. The place is very close to a number of restaurants and things to do and not a long drive to downtown Denver. We really enjoyed the location and the cleanliness of the house."

There were neat little bars, shops, brunch spots, and more all just a 10 minute or so walk away! Hops & Pie was one of the best pizza and beer experiences I've had in a while, and I'm super stoked that Eric recommended the place. :)

Everything inside of the house was great and the bed was super comfy. 10/10 would definitely stay there again!"

The place was clean, had all the amenities we needed, and plenty of room for all of us. The location is just perfect for walking to the grocery store, coffee shops, food, etc. We'd definitely stay here again for our next family trip to Denver (we're originally from there). Thanks for making us feel at home Mike!"

The neighborhood is fantastic, and is close to great restaurants! Just go ahead and book. "

1959918,94001273,2016-08-14,85918035,Patrick,"Mike was quick with responses to my questions and rental request. His house rules were very agreeable and his instructions were well put together.

Little things make the difference. Cooking tools for meals, toiletries that might have been left at home and coffee were all there. 

The best thing about this place was that is was SUPER close to Downtown. I walked pretty much everywhere.

I had one other person with me. This meant that I got the couch which was very comfortable for sleeping. 

The overall condition of the apartment was very well kept.

I didn't know if from the listing but there was an outdoor patio that was great to sit out on during the evening."
29261204,341326508,2018-10-26,38399717,Kurt,"Vince's place as stylish, clean, and in a great spot for visiting downtown Denver (and for traveling in from the airport, since the train to Union Station is just $9 and drops a you short walk from Vince's place).

Vince is a great host, who's communicative and concerned about my stay."

16944084,318490546,2018-09-03,31285128,Michael,"John's place is a funky, retro cool house on the block that we wish we all had. John's house is also the best looking one on the street in every aspect. John had a very warm welcome upon my arrival with what felt like to me Southern hospitality met by the laid back mountain culture. He works in a bakery and had a cup cake waiting for me with the same design of John Fishman's dress of the band called Phish. Rudy, his best friend and dog companion, is as lovable and attentive as man's best friend could possibly be. I never return to an Airbnb host only due to the fact that I enjoy new, shared experiences. I do intend to request John's residence again because in my eyes, it is as perfect a place that I would choose to live myself. Please do not hesitate in booking this place if you can."
16846436,498977209,2019-07-30,102397932,Guillermo,Just as described. Great place to stay if you are visiting Denver!! Very clean and super close to downtown! Highly recommend.

7603546,279769402,2018-06-21,42770162,Joel,Dennis was great and by far the fastest responder I've had. we were on an Uber ride from the airport when we found that the hotel didn't have our resevation. I booked the place and told him we'd be there in 20. It was (seemingly) no problem for him. He was very friendly and accommodating. Superhost indeed.

22139867,262057027,2018-05-07,50021449,Eden,This place was exactly what we needed. Pictures are 100% accurate. Self check in was simple. There was plenty of parking. We were able to park our U-Haul trailer while we explored Denver. It was clean and cute. I would definitely stay again.
16548314,206510472,2017-10-25,58650342,Scott,This was a very nice place to stay. Conveniently located. Would highly recommend to family or friends.

The room was very clean and pleasantly appointed.  Her 3 pooches were adorable.  The house was within walking distance of nice places to eat and other attractions.  If not we were an Uber ride away from downtown and anything else.  Rita had excellent recommendations for places to eat and go.  We would absolutely stay here again.  It was awesome!
26520064,542831055,2019-10-06,288717391,Jim,"A cozy sanctuary just outside the bustle of Downtown Denver.  Well located for travel, comfy beds, and a well stocked entertainment center. 5/5 would rent again."
20652963,536411416,2019-09-26,168140772,Peter,"What a cozy spot! Me and a friend stayed here for 3 nights and it was so comfortable. Lots of privacy, a cool shower, an awesome coffee machine, a retro post modern radio and the biggest most comfortable bed ever. The location is great too. Super close to downtown and in a really nice neighborhood by a huge lake. I will def stay here next time I visit Denver."
10266757,267469718,2018-05-21,87345850,Joseph,"Great little hidden gem in Denver. Wonderful modern amenities for the wide open studio. Great location, you can use the city transportation and be to downtown in no time! Loved the tidbits he gave us in his binder, and enjoyed our stay!"

Place was very clean. "
21608586,342492626,2018-10-28,20864170,Tammy,"It is a lovely apt and very clean.  Kudos to the nice quality linens and towels which it is not always the case at airbnb.  The host provided very clear and detailed instructions. However, the elevator is extremely slow and did not work for a few times.  We had to hike all the way up to the apartment after we came back from hiking from Rocky Mountain.   The dial to enter the main entrance also did not work well.  I got lucky a few times that someone was there to open the door.  Therefore only 4 stars instead of 5."
34089466,531099590,2019-09-16,104314158,Teresa,Our stay here was great!

9710417,94910318,2016-08-17,29131359,Chris,Beautiful little place in a quiet but central neighborhood of Denver.  Easy communication.  Climate control in the house worked great. 
6515185,190232007,2017-09-03,1561350,Christian,"Quiet, cool, and private b-level pad in a very up and coming part of town. The dual rain shower made every day start off on the right foot and I found the private patio artwork just a nice added touch. Definitely gave you a local feel here. We ended up taking a cheap Lyft or walking to everything we wanted to see in Denver. Parking our rental car was a little tricky at first but we figured it out no problem. We unfortunately didn't get to run into our hosts during our stay but never needed to. Their directions are clear for access and have added notes & amenities so you can rest easy on questions like Wi-Fi or the patio door lock. We had a great time!"
37915799,532960151,2019-09-20,41298846,Lauren,"Amy and David’s space is gorgeous! Awesome location, very clean, and great amenities. And of course Bali! I would definitely stay here again :)"
15551405,428147650,2019-03-24,55613304,Jennifer,"So, first of all, I want to say that Dale and Sarah worked really hard to fix the issue I had with the upstairs tenants. Excellent customer service. The inconsiderate upstairs neighbors were not their fault. 

The place is great for a weekend. However, dont expect greatness. This place is perfect for a few friends in their 20's.

It's an older bulding. Crazy Friday night party the neighbors had till 4 am aside (Which Dale and Sarah handeled excellently) you can hear every move the neighbors make. If you are a light sleeper, beware. The furniture is decent, but the cheapest Ikea had to offer. The most uncomfortable living room I've ever encountered. I highly suggest a sleeper sofa. No one should have to sit or sleep on that kilck klack. 

Everything was nice and neat, but was a little shabby. Cupboard doors are askew and the tub had no stopper, so shower only. 

Not a bad experence, but I'm not sure I would stay here again. I like my accommodations a bit more luxurious. No fault of the owner."
22213346,565705011,2019-11-17,152696343,Kathleen,"Very nice house, neat and clean! Neighborhood felt very safe and close to grocery store and restaurants in Highlands area!"

Highly recommend! "

7948813,134889321,2017-03-01,53030416,Natolie,"This house was just lovely, great use of space and very open feeling despite lower square footage you have everything you could desire. We really felt like we were residents in this lovely neighborhood where we never even saw any other people or heard any noise. The back patio is just lovely with string lights that made it even more enjoyable to see my 2 year old dance under snowflakes for the first time. I had to cancel another reservation after they ""realized"" I had a toddler but she was welcome here and the house was relatively kid proof! We had not one instance of destruction and there's a lot of live plants which we all really enjoyed. The house is only minutes away from Lake Steam Baths where I spent 6 hours and had 3 hours of massage at for under $150 total. I will definitely be back! I live and work in Austin as a massage therapist and there's no place like Lake Steam here!! "
28963740,468529855,2019-06-12,264847449,Jaron,"McAnthony was very quick to respond and very welcoming as a host. The space was clean and was perfectly located between the airport and the city. It is likely that there will be other guests in different rooms during your stay; we unfortunately had some other guests who were disruptive during the night, which wasn’t very pleasant. However McAnthony was very responsive about these complaints, and as long as you’re staying with cooperative guests, you’ll have a great experience."
4545539,54593303,2015-11-22,33277751,Matthew,Tyler was a perfect host. The apartment is absolutely perfect for a getaway. What more can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said? This is the measuring stick by which all other AirBNB locations should be judged. 
6373869,179893360,2017-08-08,70489389,Alex,"Ryan's home was clean and very comfortable! He was a great host, had the room ready on time, and was very helpful! Had great recommendations for the area and made our stay very enjoyable! "

8650761,483577636,2019-07-07,79809167,Sandra,"Great for group trips if you want to stay together. It was the perfect location for our graduate school reunion - we could walk to multiple places to eat/drink, or, take a short Lyft ride closer to down town. Be advised that two of the sleeping areas on on a 3rd level - so not the coolest in the summer heat."

The condo was spotless, the exercise room was very nice, and the off-street parking was great. It could not have been better, really. We love to walk around and look at homes and landscaping, and the Cap Hill/Wash Park neighborhoods are lovely. "

This place is everything you could want in an AIRBnB. If you are trying to stay in Capital Hill this is the place you want to book.
16304484,560127977,2019-11-05,116452988,Angela,"Ryan’s home was PERFECT for our 5 day stay! It is located so close to everything in  Denver and he even recommended some great restaurants & things to see! It was a super safe area and we either walked or were able to take a 5-10 minute Uber to any fun district & there’s a grocery store nearby!! He had everything we needed and more: plenty of towels, neatly labeled amenities around the home, and multiple ways to make coffee. It was a wonderful experience and he even checked in on us throughout the stay!"

Apartment - comfy for one or two, stocked with everything you might need, safe and private. Amazing water pressure - you won't wanna get out of the shower. 
Host - Jason had this place prepped for me on very short notice, everything was sparkling cleans and stocked with everything needed. Communication was short and sweet, which is perfect considering my staying there for almost two months, makes you feel like it's your place and not have to check-in with the host every few days. 

Note - you will be living in middle of all kinds of action in downtown. There will be machinery noise, train horns, fire truck sirens and car horns to be heard."
24746875,282538760,2018-06-27,116595049,Jessica,Spacious and trendy basement apartment that is a short trip away from downtown. Loved my stay there!

7931953,89040007,2016-07-26,33668604,Angelina,"This was a charming house in a good neighborhood. The hosts left an awesome list of nearby places. I took one of their recommendations and walked to a restaurant nearby...I felt safe walking the half mile at night by myself. I was a solo travelled so the house was huge for me, I'd recommend for a group of couples or family. Overall, great experience, wish I could've stayed longer. "
26328157,520602182,2019-08-30,165915377,Alec,Great place and nice host who provided nice tips on what to do in the city
15510935,307052887,2018-08-13,98965844,Cydney,"Mike's place is an amazing deal! Not only are you getting a super clean and modern house to share– It's located in one of the best areas in Denver. Only a 1-minute walk to Black Eye Coffee and just a little more for some awesome breweries. He also has all kinds of suggestions ready for you no matter what you might be looking for. Best Breakfast, lunch, dinner, breweries, or other fun– he has it all listed out. When my boyfriend Michael and I visited for the weekend, we were on a whirlwind of a trip filled with lots of obligations for my cousin's wedding. Mike made sure we knew of fun things close by that we could check out whenever we had a free moment, made sure we had the iron ready at our disposal to get ready for the big day, and the whole space was super relaxing and quiet. If we're back in Denver we'll definitely be looking to stay here again."
6869189,88524302,2016-07-24,71629897,Charlie,"Lucas was very flexible and easy going to work with.  He was very informative when it came to the instructions of the house, and he wanted to make sure we felt welcomed.  He gave us advice on some local spots, and some do's/don'ts.  That was very much appreciated being from out of town.  This spot was worth every nickel, and my friends and I had a great time!  Would HIGHLY recommend this location and Lucas as a host!"
1223593,35014074,2015-06-14,33406125,Ashley,"I had the pleasure of staying with Cynthia for a quick weekend in Denver. She made my very first airbnb experience so easy and comfortable, it was a delight! She was super responsive whenever I messaged her prior to arrival, and when I met her in person she was an incredibly kind and welcoming host. I found Cynthia to be a sweet, smart, and vibrant lady. Finally, the room I stayed in was awesome - light, airy, and on an upper floor, with a very comfy bed and spacious private bath in room. "
665622,43510224,2015-08-20,13701234,Ryan,"Becky's place is in a great location! It's an adorable neighborhood, everything is very walkable, and there is good food/drink nearby. The keyless entry into the apartment is very convenient. Becky was very responsive to our needs. The apartment is cute, but it was a lot like staying at a friends place. When we arrived there were some damp sheets in the wash and towels in the dryer. I folded the towels and threw the sheets in the dryer. Not a big deal, but something I'm not necessarily used to seeing when doing BnB."
923994,23127246,2014-11-23,8644017,Stella,"Rob was a great host.  Check in and check out was very easy and the house is located in a great location.  The house was very clean and well appointed with everything we needed.  The backyard was a plus with privacy as well as the hot tub.  We took advantage of his bikes in the garage and explored the area--City park was right nearby and a great place to walk/ride.  It was walking distance to many restaurants, bars and music venues is another reason why we'll be calling Rob to book with him in the future.  "
2119667,69686431,2016-04-12,5323020,Christian,"First I have to say that the place is super cute, the location is great.

18002228,242906270,2018-03-13,23398421,Anne,Christina’s place was absolutely beautiful. I came with some friends for a long weekend and it was a great location- easy to walk to restaurants (Jelly Cafe was a favorite) and shops. Would definitely come back!
21975597,316643134,2018-08-31,25803874,Kristy,"Doug’s place is a lovely little oasis in a great location! Cool neighborhood of older homes with tons of character, City Park is a little over a block away to the North and the Bluebird district on Colfax is only a few houses away in the other direction. We had some great meals steps away from the house.

The whole place is spotlessly clean and has a nice kitchen setup for your stay. Bathroom is lovely and large. If we find ourselves in Denver again, we would love to stay again!"
20697678,286586899,2018-07-06,143930432,Karen,"Ryan provided very helpful food recommendations in the city and for exploring. Easy to reach via text, quick responses, very approachable. Environment was very chill and welcoming. Neighborhood is quiet, beautiful, and a walkable distance to nearby pubs, restaurants, and the botanical garden. LOVED IT."
24781433,285020465,2018-07-02,6682728,Vladimir,"James and his roommates are awesome, caring , and laid-back hosts.  Ryan , one of James's roommates, welcomed me into their home and gave me lots of great advice on local eats and things to do. James and I had some great conversations about sports and life in general. The brothers they live with are really kind and welcoming. I felt like I had known these guys for a lot longer than 4 days. 

Book with these guys and you wont regret it. They are close to amazing food (Bird Call) and cheap, delicious drinks (715 Bar). When I'm in Denver next, I'll be staying with these guys!

P.S. thanks for taking me to Syrup guys!!! YUM"
22529249,334242241,2018-10-08,13647118,Eugene,"I needed a place to stay in a very quick turnaround time and uncertain leave date, so was in need of someone with good communication to find the right place for us. Skylar was awesome in communicating throughout our stay, super helpful. The place was also nicely decorated and very clean. Place is close from most attractions also. Highly recommend for sure. Thanks again for your understanding and hospitality Skylar!"

18596199,548089897,2019-10-16,7202489,Britton,"Such a darling spot! I was in Denver for a business trip and Liz & Yosef's place was perfect. It's just 10 mins from downtown. Check in was super easy with a keypad at the door. Wifi was lightning fast and the couch is so comfy for nighttime emailing in front of the TV. It was nice to not have the usual cold leather couch at an AirBnB and you could see they'd just freshly vacuumed the couch! Decor is lush and updated. Bed was great. Kitchenette is perfect - just like you'd see at a hotel with one - complete with coffee maker and even some snacks! The garden apartment is underneath the main house so you hear some sound upstairs, but nothing distracting. Highly recommend for any business traveler!"
15846078,528227754,2019-09-12,80069947,Sara,"My fiancé and I arrived to Tama’s place at the tail end of our vacation ready for a quiet, comfortable stay. Thankfully, that’s exactly what Tama provided! She had great tips about the surrounding area (we checked out The Elm on our first night and loved it) and she had plenty of towels, blankets and amenities available. We left feeling refreshed and satisfied! I would definitely recommend Tama’s place to anyone."
629194,104201847,2016-09-25,12001646,Vanessa,"Juan's studio was perfect for our needs and cozy for the two of us. The location could not have been better for our adventures of going downtown, heading out to a show at Red Rocks, or hopping over to Boulder for a quick stop. We did not meet Juan, but the check-in/check-out process went very smoothly. Would highly recommend!"
3479122,162388418,2017-06-20,107955428,Maureen,"This was a great place to stay & Sam was a great host! As Sam mentions in his comments, it is located in an urban area so be prepared to see a lot of homeless people. The location was very convenient to all of downtown Denver so that was perfect for our stay."
21422875,219933168,2017-12-19,158120480,Tony,The place was great and in good location to great places to eat and drink. Michelle was awesome with quick response to anything you need and also very good recommendations to place to go. The place was clean and very chill I enjoyed it and the location it was in.  Downtown isn't that far. Went with 4 other friends so the room has plenty of space. As a 420 friendly guy we were able to enjoy the back yard with comfortable chairs and a table. I liked this place I would totally recommend it!
1622963,44038534,2015-08-23,4170530,Poonam,"Tanya was a friendly and accommodating host, and we felt right at home in her beautiful house. The neighborhood was convenient and chic, and Tanya was a very warm and welcoming person to chat with and get a feel for things to do around Denver for our short stay! Absolutely enjoyed our time here!"

10401469,78205814,2016-06-05,2303703,Shona,"Todd was a great host! He was very friendly and accommodating. I really enjoyed my stay in Denver and glad I picked his place to stay. The room and bed was very comfortable and spacious. It is in a good location, I had a bike and enjoyed my ride along the cherry creek trail into town. Todd allowed me to use the rooftop pool with amazing views when he was there. He also showed me around town a bit and gave me some great suggestions. "
4758581,75984684,2016-05-23,30219919,Amy,"Mark's home is fabulous! It's was located in Park Hill and comfortably fit a 3 generation family. Besides each having our own bedroom, we had several living areas to find our own space. Mark provided all the basic necessities. We do hope to stay there again on future trips if it's available!"
364585,28168859,2015-03-19,27433472,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful experience at Nicholas' town home. The house comfortably fit all six of us and was very nice. The listing is accurate. The rooftop patio has a great view of the sunrise and sunset. This place would be especially great for a calmer group as it is in close proximity to other houses. The kitchen had everything we would have expected. The rest of the house had plenty of sheets, towels, etc. Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. The location is also a bonus. We spent the first part of our trip in downtown Denver, about ten minutes away, and would have spent our entire time in Washington Park if we had to do it over again."

1785877,296870299,2018-07-26,73679042,Harvey,"Cynthia was a wonderful, welcoming and attentive host. The house was as stated, a beautiful Victorian built around the turn of the century.  The age and style lends both the beauty and limitations to the property. You share a bathroom with other guests, but the house decor was attractive and interesting. The location of the house was perfect for me, check-in was flexible, and all in all I would definitely choose to stay there again."

I’m not a fan of pets, so it was kind of yucky to get up from the couch/bed and pet hair be on our clothes. Overall it was worth it!!! Will definitely stay again!!!"
1223612,80392101,2016-06-18,76662433,Srinivasa,"Cynthia was friendly and extremely welcoming. She made us comfortable and clean beds. The location was ideal, with just needing to walk a few blocks to get to bars or restaurants.  I would try to come back if I visit Denver again."
11192056,337280453,2018-10-15,28054992,Brittany,"Kinga’s place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. It was everything, and more. She kept me updated on the check in, and all of the access information. I love that she has a designated place for you to park your car conveniently downstairs. She gives very detailed information about how to get in, and what to do. Kinga’s place is perfect, and an ideal location for couples. Her place let’s you feel right at home. I love the decor, and how cozy she kept it (since Denver received their first snow during our stay). Kinga was very accommodating, nice, and professional. Thank you!!!"

With parking! Clean as a whistle, and Robert and Brandon made everything easy.  A girlfriend and I shared the apartment for a long weekend and couldn't have asked for more."

Short walk to the light rail makes this a perfect location to explore Denver. I'll definitely be back...thanks guys!"

20347577,188238247,2017-08-28,48589468,Owen,"Overall a great stay.
The location and size of the house was great even though it was just me. A small family would suit this property perfectly.
I had some trouble with a pet smell throughout the house. As I don't have pets it was very noticeable, even after frebreeze and opening the windows.

Would stay here again if the pet smell is resolved."
7843605,262960520,2018-05-10,169924713,Connor,A great place to stay in downtown Denver. Would recommend.

17498473,352745608,2018-11-25,107576241,Vinay,"Excellent place to stay! 
Very clean, with self checkin and checkout.
Rafer also accommodated our request to early checkin. Even though they were on a different vacation their responses were quick. When we asked to increase the temperature of the room, they remotely helped us out and pointed to the spare heater to use during our stay.
Would love to be their guest again :)

Thanks guys!"
1223593,92058525,2016-08-07,29895496,Justine,"We enjoyed our stay at Cynthia's house. The neighborhood is lovely, it's very historic. Her home has a lot of charm and character and beautiful vintage furniture. Due to the increasing population, it was difficult to find street parking at night, but I think this would happen in every city given the downtown location, and this slight inconvenience was well worth the proximity to our event. Cynthia is very friendly and easy to talk to, if we are ever again in the area, we would definitely consider repeating our stay."
8941796,344478674,2018-11-03,62165015,Dana,Staying at Chris's place was great! Easy check in and great communication. Location was perfect for spending time downtown Denver as well as West in the mountains. Space was very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend for your trip to Denver!

The apartment is really cozy, comes equipped with a hot tub and fireplace, and is only about 10 minutes away from downtown Denver. Highly recommended! "
16855990,209961618,2017-11-06,151267775,Grant,Great place for a stay in Denver! 10 min drive from the main districts in town. Clean and friendly

36385550,527001719,2019-09-09,123505748,Kasey,"We did cancel our reservation and chose to stay in a hotel for similar value. We did not stay the night after initially checking in. This review is based off of check in and  viewing the house and room. We were surprised by a strong fishy odor throughout the house and close quarters to other guests. The house was in a safe, quiet neighborhood and very close to the airport. The room was just as advertised. The hosts responded quickly and was understanding of our decision to book a hotel to better meet our needs."
31261351,500131160,2019-08-01,122383533,Joe,Awesome place.  Top notch location and space!

It's location is great. We got around on Bcycle. Lots of stops nearby. Very close to the botanical gardens, downtown, and a couple parks. Would definitely stay again!"
28223618,431230236,2019-03-31,58386806,Krysti,"Perfect spot for a weekend in Denver! We had a rental car, so I'm not sure what's walk-able close by - but everything we wanted to visit was a 10 minute drive away. Sarah's house is the ideal AirBnb."
26816760,527782540,2019-09-11,281811410,Timothy,"It was a nice place to stay. The “hot tub” is just a large bath tub which was still very nice. There weren’t extra towels in the bathroom, I’m sure Daniel would’ve remedied it but we had brought our own so it was okay."
15787181,463684279,2019-06-03,87480442,Paigh,Great place ! Was amazing with communication appreciate it so much .

14833679,188218706,2017-08-28,124558068,Damian,"Nice room in an older but renovated house. Tram-station is 400m away and a lot of stuff is in walkable distance (supermarket, dispensary, liquor store, SantaFee art district...) . Even was great. He showed me the nightlife in Denver and I had a lot of interesting discussions with him, his roommates and friends of them. The kitchen is large and everything needed to cook some meals is available. The patio with the fountains is lovely and great for hanging out and smoking (420 friendly). There is no lock on the room itself, but this is perfectly fine. I felt very safe there. Be prepared to party during the evenings/nights.
I can wholeheartedly recommend a stay there."

18601412,552003148,2019-10-20,78857297,Diane,Very nice house in a fine neighborhood! Very convenient location. Susan is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable. Bed is very comfy.

20697678,263339128,2018-05-11,64758308,Matt,"Did not have a chance to Meet Ryan, but he was able to communicate via text, and the location was really beneficial to sightseeing in Denver outside of the downtown area."
18582812,177707537,2017-08-03,140326409,Traci,"This is a great space close to Denver's nightlife, ballpark, and restaurants. We went to a concert at Mile High and a Rockies game. We ubered to Mile High but enjoyed the walk to the ballpark. The bed was very comfortable, the condo was clean, and it was a great central area."
24624885,345698363,2018-11-05,217142110,Trevor,"Very clean, very helpful recommendations. Close to downtown, Uber/Lyft is everywhere. Made our stay so much more enjoyable"
32066568,456852569,2019-05-22,239321,Tatiana,Great simple place to stay close to a lot.
21591739,518995706,2019-08-27,8177546,Amanda,"The place was just OK. Had issues and left early, due to: Bugs crawling around the living room and bedroom. Bedroom had broken blinds so people walking by could see in; living room had blue towel hanging from the blinds; again because they were broken. Spider webs and live bugs in the corners, place was definitely NOT cleaned fully for the $90 payment. Bedsheets had black crumbs and dirt in them when you pulled back the covers. Couch was dirty and had crumbs in it. This place has potential so LONG as it is actually professionally cleaned, bedroom is better cared for, blinds get replaced, and they clean up the kitchen cabinets. As a fellow host, this place needs attention !! But once addressed, could have solid potential."
30559980,483739166,2019-07-07,47415535,George,"Fantastic stay during the 4th of July weekend.  Excellent location.  Close enough for fun, far enough away to not hear it."
24520787,508320436,2019-08-12,258598011,Beau,"The space is better than description.  When I was there, it felt like I was staying at a 5 star hotel rather than an Airbnb.  Not only would I recommend this place, I will continue to try and book this place anytime I am coming to town."
10040421,104447987,2016-09-26,19958062,Stephen,"Lori made our stay seamless. The neighborhood is vibrant and inviting. Her place is great for a group swinging through Denver for a night or two. We didn't get to try the water, or write a note for the wall, but thank you again for the gestures and the stay.  "

23632784,282168573,2018-06-26,75958724,Luis,"Place is just as described. Very spacious and in a hip neighborhood. Plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. Very close to downtown Denver. Very clean and perfect for families, or group of friends. All the essentials you could need are there for your convenience in case you forgot something. The only issue that I want someone to be aware of is that there is no central AC unit, It was not a big deal for us as the house has fans in every room and portable fans you can move around. We will definitely look for Brandy when we come back to Denver."
5966633,464047700,2019-06-04,8295489,Kerry,Convenient & cozy spot to enjoy Wash Park and downtown Denver with great wifi!
4227772,84243413,2016-07-06,61107869,Erin,We had a great stay at Luanne's after a long day of driving. My dog loved the front yard area and was able to run around and stretch our her legs.

Nicely-furnished &  thoughtfully provisioned (great little kitchen,  washer/dryer a real plus) - Patrick really has the gift of hospitality and was a pleasure to work with!  Would definitely stay again & have already recommended to others."

6017776,149346982,2017-05-03,39875794,Marama,"McKenna was totally lovely and accommodating. Her place is really cute and the mid century decor was spot on. 
She was super sweet - I broke a fingernail just before I got there and she hunted me out some nail clippers, there were snacks waiting for me and 2 chocolates by the bed. 

It's not a big place, but exactly as described. 
Really quiet and comfortable. "

23448926,491029803,2019-07-19,57278123,Jesse,"This place was perfect for my business trip. It was comfortable, quiet, and well-equipped, The location was also more convenient than I'd imagine - the house is a 2 minute walk away from some of the hottest food places in Denver (Little Man ice cream, Linger, El Five, Lola's Coastal Mexican), and only a 20 minute walk away from downtown. 

Plus, Brian is a very attentive host who replies to all messages very promptly."

If you traveler forget something you may need, Monica and Jhon will have it ready for you. Communication was excellent, cleanliness was unbeatable and it just feels like home away from home."
24502937,507446788,2019-08-11,18496411,Senka,A perfect Airbnb if you’re looking for a clean and modern space WITH GYM AND POOL (!!). Fantastic stay altogether. Bernadette is extremely responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again when in Denver.

18996370,265907927,2018-05-18,188432798,Anthony,"The only thing I kind of had a problem with was how the people above us were loud, and I would not recommend this BnB for y’all people. I am 6 foot and barely fit, my head was 2 inches from ceiling. Altogether, very nice spot though. Travis was a great host and he had great tips. It is a great spot for couples near the downtown area!"
22513575,251310958,2018-04-07,171421721,Dennis,Great place to experience Denver while just far enough away to have privacy
6156061,436294335,2019-04-12,996625,Brian,A very clean space that is close to lot's of action!
24644409,528800662,2019-09-13,118184924,Julie,Cruz was an incredible host.  Very responsive and actually went out to get me a hair dryer when I had a mini meltdown over the fact there wasn't one.  Crisis aborted and everything was amazing.   He really goes out of his way for excellence. Two thumbs way up!!

20730936,263308654,2018-05-11,3982847,Dusty,So close to more food than you can handle - as well as public transit to downtown. Couldn’t ask for a better stay.
25455417,414000745,2019-02-18,72790235,Blake,"Cozy, comfortable, and private, this carriage house was a great home base for three nights in Denver. Many restaurants are within a 5-minute walk, and our experience was highlighted by a great Nepalese dinner. Downtown Denver is about 30-minutes away on foot, a short ride on the 32 bus, or about $10 on Lyft. The unit was immaculately cleaned and David provided clear check-in communication. We highly recommend!"

787456,319191989,2018-09-05,55275486,Angela,"Pam and Brad are very friendly, helpful hosts who welcomed us into their home as if we were friends.   The chickens outside are just as social!  Privacy when we wanted it and interaction with delightful hosts when we wanted company.  Things we enjoyed:  morning coffee on the front porch, looking at their abundant garden out back, playing games and giant Jenga  in one of their outdoor sitting areas by the little koi pond listening to water sounds.  The home is in a great location as the Botanic Gardens are across the street and we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.  Great ""home base"" while enjoying Denver and comfortable to return to at the end of a full day!"
14593779,494684116,2019-07-24,184487067,Prescott,"The house was very cute and welcoming. Quite clean and you can tell they wanted to make sure their guests had a good time. The house itself looked like it was described, but the owners were just above us the whole time, the walls were thin and they had a toddler who ran around upstairs often. Wasn’t bad, just was not entirely what we had in mind. they were very polite, but i would recommend that if you’re looking for some alone time where you can be as loud as you want, this might not be the best place to stay."
24043228,536386281,2019-09-26,160671745,Marshele,Very cleanly and spacious. Had everything we needed for the trip to be perfect. Definitely worth the price! Definitely recommend this one.

5070640,111702169,2016-11-01,72341268,Sandra,"We enjoyed everything about Andrea's carriage house. The location is amazing (less than a block to great restaurants on 32nd), the carriage house is so nicely furnished and such a pleasant place to stay. Three of us stayed there and the pull out sofa bed was really comfortable. She left us some basic supplies and fresh fruit which was appreciated. Parking was convenient. The neighbourhood felt nice and safe to walk at night. Trattoria Stella which is a 2 minute walk away was so good we ate there twice. Highly recommended. "

There was an initial problem with being contacted regarding the check-in process (as I had an international mobile), but we had no concerns once we reached the apartment and we enjoyed our stay.  The location is excellent for anyone wanting to explore the city. "

Kelsi was super accommodating to our unique needs with a baby, and provided us with some free beer after the washer broke. It was fixed quite quickly though. We really enjoyed our stay. 10/10 would stay again if in Denver. Thanks Kelsi."

I was attending a conference at the Sheraton and it was an easy walk in the morning. There are great places for coffee or breakfast close by. Georgia set up coffee every morning and also made some great zucchini bread. I had a great stay."
16733876,519031925,2019-08-27,196179576,Jaimee,"Pipes and small bongs/dab rigs included! Papers, filters, and a roller are there as well, although the size of the roller doesn’t fit the size of the paper. This is a nice space that conveniently caters to the 420 community. It helped make our stay more enjoyable. They offer robes and slippers too! Very comfortable, and accommodating. I’d love to know what brand of towels are offered because they’re great and very absorbent."
1911814,88160050,2016-07-23,79700660,Kurt,"We are Airbnb ""newbies"", this was our first experience. We needed a place to be our base while visiting our daughter and her husband in Denver. She suggested we try an Airbnb rather than a hotel, and found some options for us to look at.

We were very pleased with our stay at Randall's accommodations. It was very clean, in a nice neighborhood, and very quiet. While there, we found the whole experience to be very relaxing. I appreciated not bumbling around a hotel lobby, dodging people in hallways, hearing people in hallways, listening to children running up and down hallways. Ugh! Everything you need is in the kitchen, including a Keurig, which really made it feel like home. It was great!

We will certainly be looking into staying here on future visits to Denver, and will be looking for other Airbnb establishments whenever traveling in the future.

Thanks!"
16548314,227052643,2018-01-13,76620664,Allison,"Tomas’s apartment is even cozier than the pictures show. Tomas made it easy for us to check in even though we arrived later in the evening and the location is very convenient, right next to the Botanical Gardens and Cheesman Park. Our only regret was that we didn’t get to stay there longer than one night!"
16172759,422727063,2019-03-11,20571422,Francois,"We visited Denver in freezing temperatures at the beginning of March. Hannnah's apartment was warm and cozy, quiet, and centrally situated, clean and well furnished, with a convenient off-the-street parking."

6623325,507653577,2019-08-11,206020426,Mark,"Kelly is an incredible SuperHost -- she is so good that she should be wearing a cape with an ""S"" on the front.

I am new to Airbnb and I made some major mistakes on my last-minute reservation -- but she helped sort things out and we had the best weekend.  Her place is clean, incredibly spacious, and in a great neighborhood -- and has the full set of cable channels as a bonus.

Note - the residence is huge but not soundproof so you probably don't want to rent this one if you are going to throw late night parties."
21947025,325754044,2018-09-20,135232697,Sylvi,"Hands down the best Airbnb I’ve experienced! This apartment is sparkling clean, bright and cheerful, perfectly located, walkable to great restaurants and activities, and surprisingly quiet for an urban high rise. We loved falling asleep and waking up to beautiful city views, and appreciated having all the comforts of a private home. Parking was beyond easy! Rene, many thanks - you were an exceptional host!"

4180622,25450703,2015-01-16,25760311,Jakob,"This was my first airbnb stay, and I can't imagine it getting much better. The apartment is just as described, all new appliances, very clean, and well stocked with anything you could need during the stay. The location is great, with plenty of shopping and restaurants within a short walk, and easy access to downtown. Maureen is extremely welcoming and only a quick phone call away if you need help with anything. I definitely plan on staying here again and suggesting it to any visiting friends or family in the future."

6488535,42405531,2015-08-13,35419113,Brittany,"The apartment was awesome! It had everything we could ever imagine needing, as well as some great beers and treats left for us by  Brandon and Robert.  We felt very safe and secure, not to mention very cool, using codes to get in and out of the doors. The apartment is also in a great location, with several bars and restaurants within walking distance. Brandon and Robert had a handbook for the apartment that had suggestions for what to see and do close by, and this was very helpful. There is an air conditioning unit in the bedroom window and it keeps the bedroom and bathroom just the right temperature. The kitchen and living room however do have a tendency to become a bit warm. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again!"

Dustin’s second floor open concept place is fabulous, and far exceeded our expectations.  Dustin was great with communication; we can defiantly see why he’s a super host.  We can’t wait for our next visit!"

9665678,106162374,2016-10-04,5211756,Sean,"Tim's house was the perfect base for our long weekend in Denver. The location is convenient and the neighborhood is nice and quiet at night - we slept great. 

The house is lovely; it's older and as such it has a lot of charm and character. It's comfortably furnished and has plenty of space. Off-street parking in the alley behind the house is a big plus. 

Tim was a great host; we unfortunately did not get the chance to meet him personally but he responded quickly to questions and made sure we had everything we needed. 

"
24262468,500204427,2019-08-01,128472406,Jeffrey,"This is such cute studio that provides a ton of amenities. It is in a quiet neighborhood, I am a light sleeper and never was woken up by anything.

5794938,188831130,2017-08-30,82943715,Bruce,"This is simply a comfortable well-appointed place close to everything that you might need.  My conference was downtown.  It was easily walkable.  Taxi/Uber/Lyft probably $7-10 with tip.  Restaurants are close and they are good.  A gourmet deli/market is 2 block away and Safeway is 5-6 blocks.  The balcony rocks.  The kitchen works if you want to cook.  There is a coffee maker and all the other stuff that you would need.  Good, young neighborhood.  So much better than being hermetically sealed behind windows that do not open in a downtown hotel."
21975597,480453930,2019-07-02,253516823,Mary Ellen,Great place and location! Was very helpful and always right there for anything you needed! We will definitely staying again when we return to Denver area! 5/5!

Only a couple blocks away from the downtown core, a very short Uber drive or a 10min easy and safe walk will take you there.  The roof top patio is a great place to relax.  Overall we felt very comfortable as if we were at our own home.  Thank you for the great stay!"

26029313,464411308,2019-06-05,35591883,Tyler,"I had a wonderful time staying at Cindy’s place while in Denver! I was staying with my older brother to celebrate his birthday and her listing went above and beyond all our expectations. 
The rooms are beautifully designed and provided all amenities that you would need to have a great short stay in Denver. 
The location was easy to drive to/Lyft our way around everything we wanted to do. 
I can’t think of anything that would improve our stay and I appreciate all the thought and care that went in to this space. 
Thank you so much!"

9062588,295985737,2018-07-24,2121446,Tara,"Garett's place is super convenient to all things hip downtown Denver and decorated quite beautifully.   There were also extra thoughtful touches (great coffee, backyard area and fully equipped kitchen!).  We were traveling during a rare heat wave in Denver and on the days in the 90s we had to stay mostly in the two bedrooms in the house with a/c units.  Garett and Ryan were quick to help us combat the heat and dropped off some extra fans, which was nice.  Mornings were lovely drinking coffee downstairs with the door open to their patio and backyard. I would definitely recommend this home and would stay again.  "

The house was roomy, comfortable, stylish, perfectly clean, and had absolutely everything we could need. It's surrounded by some of Denver's coolest bars and breweries. There was heaps for us to do when we went out, but it was hard to leave the house! We loved cooking a few meals in and drinking margaritas on the roof deck. Couldn't recommend highly enough. Thanks, Kelly!"

We loved the neighborhood - it was in walking distance to Denver Central Market, RiNo, and tons of fantastic restaurants, shops, etc. It was also a very quick Lyft/Uber ride anywhere, and cars were always available within a couple minutes. The backyard was a really nice bonus. To top it off, Michael was responsive and incredibly accommodating by allowing me to store luggage before and after check in.

21726072,292700024,2018-07-18,60105585,Taylor,Both Joe and his place were great. Very quick to help when the electronic lock battery died and we couldn't get in (and thus very secure!). Called Joe and he was there in less than 15 minutes. Place was amazing and Joe left snacks out for us and there was very cute signs everywhere to let us know what was available around the house. One of the best hosts I've ever had and he wasn't even at the property! The furniture and decor was both colourful and peaceful; a very well thought out home. Would absolutely stay there again and hope you have the pleasure of doing so :)

26500661,418283769,2019-03-01,233426885,Amanda,If I could give this place/ host 10 stars I would! The location is perfect. Central to everything downtown Denver has to offer. Many walkable breweries and restaurants close by. Walking distance or a short Uber ride anywhere downtown. The location is very quiet despite being downtown. Allison gave great suggestions and was quick to respond (the Roku wasn’t working and she handed it ASAP!) highly recommend ... would stay again!
39405,455375028,2019-05-19,85395503,Brooke,"We absolutely adored the Mulberry Cottage in Denver! What an incredible space to call home for a long weekend. Jennifer & Giovanni were excellent hosts and even allowed us to drop our luggage there before check-in and after check-out. The cottage was so cozy and they had lots of little touches like coffee, coffee creamer, little snacks a full length mirror (and if you smoke, everything you need).  It was an easy Uber/jaunt to downtown so it was definitely a great value as well. We will definitely be back!"

17574946,514146869,2019-08-20,140099707,Helenka,"Our stay at Bill and Linda’s guesthouse was quite enjoyable! It was the perfect place for a long weekend trip with my friends. The space is spotless and in the perfect location to enjoy Denver itself or to drive out to some great hikes! Bill and Linda are very hospitable, providing us delicious welcome snacks and an insightful guidebook. Please be sure to contact the host before you arrive, especially if you plan on using the lockbox (apparently the code sent in the itinerary is incorrect). Unfortunately, we did have some trouble with this. But besides this one issue, Bill and Linda were very quick to respond, answer our questions, and help us when we needed it. I would definitely recommend Bill and Linda’s guesthouse to any Denver visitor!"
8474753,72738188,2016-05-04,53587266,Clayton,"Awesome visit! Unfortunately our hosts were out of town, so we didn't get to meet...

The space is exactly as described. A basement bedroom. You here footsteps from the living space above but during my stay there wasn't much late or early. 

Worked good for my stay as I was out and about all day and just slept there. If you are looking for a budget space to keep your stuff and sleep this works perfect. "
4052272,107593085,2016-10-11,545511,Jen,"Nikki was a really great host. She was quick on the response whenever I messaged her. She also gave excellent suggestions on around the town recommendations. The Spectrum Inn was very clean and the pics were pretty accurate. It was a solid amount of space for me and my two close gal pals, definitely more on the cozy side. The location is more of a short drive to fun places as oppose to walkable. You will either need to account for taking ubers to places or rent a car for sure. Its about a 35 min walk to the nearest coffee shop. Overall a really good experience. "
8718728,112913062,2016-11-08,61521909,Carina,"Had an incredible stay at The Dahlia House. Super chill atmosphere, comfy bed, adorable dog, and Rachel & Andrew are rad hosts. Recommend 1000%."

It is an easy walk to all the wonderful restaurants, bars, and breweries this neighborhood has to offer. It is only a 15-20 minute walk to downtown Denver. The neighborhood has many  building walls decorated with interesting street art. Even with the busy nightlife, the apartment was quiet. Jelena communicated with us promptly and provided us with small amenities such as cold beverages waiting in the refrigerator and apples in a bowl. The apartment was clean and exactly what we were looking for! Thanks for the stay, Jelena!"

Really delicious food and bars are within walking distance and the most I paid for an Uber trip was $12 because of the proximity of the studio to many destinations."

Definitely would stay again on a return trip."
11521979,131780516,2017-02-13,57538472,Dennis,"Jenna and Doug are the best of host and accommodated all our request.  The location is great for walking to shops, restaurants and brewery's. Our daughter lives nearby so we did not need a rental car, but if needed there is ample parking right in front of the unit.  The unit was very clean and nicely appointed.  They even included some little treats of local chips and coffee.  We had a flight delay of 3 hours and didn't get to the unit until after 2 a.m. and Doug took the time to check in with us to make sure we were comfortable at that late hour.  My wife and I own a condo in NOLA and also engage in short term rentals and we try out best to meet the needs of our guest.  Jenna and Doug exceeded our expectations and provided a great experience for us.  We will definitely stay there again.  Hopefully in May when we visit our daughter and son-in-law!  Again, top notch Airbnb host!"

Would recommend people to stay here!
26130807,488908074,2019-07-15,164772792,Elena,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Curtis Park Club. Hosts put a lot of love and effort into creating a unique experience for their guests: from the property's interior design to little tips and guides for the surrounding neighborhood fun. Our room was very clean and comfortable. It was easy to reach out to the host with questions and concerns, which were addressed and solved almost immediately.

8211278,105063522,2016-09-30,75818999,Virginia,"We had a group of 6 people sharing this house during a scientific conference that was located downtown. The house was a great fit for us. It was great to share living and kitchen space to discuss current and future work as well as being conveniently located to the Colorado Convention Center. The house was pretty much as expected, although photos made it look bigger. It still has a lot of space and is very comfortable. We all commented on the comfort of the bed and sheets as well as the convenience of having a kitchen. It is a nice neighborhood, very quite and felt vey safe. The host was great, responding to texts and emails promptly. It was a great experience."

When we arrived everything was sparkling clean and check-in was a breeze as we could let ourselves in after arriving late. We met John and Tara briefly and they were very kind. I was a bit worried about noise, being in the basement unit, but that was not a problem at all, plenty of privacy and quiet in the morning when we wanted to sleep in."

The neighborhood felt more remote than expected (coming from New York we weren't used to empty streets and the occasional staring neighbor), but we were able to rent B-Cycle bikes nearby and go to all of the spots we wanted. The home itself was so well curated and stocked, and just felt very nice to come back to at the end of the day. Great spot."

9591731,134892106,2017-03-01,87594869,Shawn,Great place to stay and enjoy Colorado. Across the street from a dispensary. Great bar and Italian food down the block. (Gennaro's). Everything you need is close by. Can't wait to stay here again.

3757586,361865035,2018-12-24,231025950,Jeremy,Everything was so far above my expectations even with all of the incredible reviews. I was not familiar with Greyhounds. They are the most friendly and relaxed dogs that do not bark. My stay could not have possibly been better than it was. Consider yourself lucky if this is not already reserved during your trip dates.
12606455,483732731,2019-07-07,120965841,Jack,Deana's place was spacious and beautiful. Excellent host who made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Highly recommend staying with Deana if you have the chance.

14538608,238434360,2018-02-25,54802559,Mark,"We had a great time staying at the Garden Apartment! The location was great.

Sam and Maggie were also great hosts. They were so helpful and accommodating with our arrival, and were always quick to respond to any messages or questions. I would definitely recommend a stay here!"
21975597,283359419,2018-06-29,188037468,J,"We had a wonderful time at Doug's lovely turn of the century home. The apt had recently been remodeled and was clean and bright. The bathroom with its roomy  shower was spotless, along with the well supplied kitchen. Off the Apt was a lovely garden. The Airb&b was off of Colfax Blvd. which was easy to find and surrounded by restaurants, cafes, clubs and close to downtown, entertainment, etc. The bed was very comfortable, quiet and parking was not an issue as Doug supplied us with a parking pass. When in Denver we would make reservations with Doug again."
4121643,88928941,2016-07-26,1983332,Kevin,"This is a very comfortable room in an apartment in a quiet complex.  Some nice pluses are a patio right outside the room (I spent many pleasant mornings there) and some of the best ethnic food in the Denver metro area a 10-minute drive away.  Mik was an excellent host, always responding quickly to any questions. "
14087278,135160407,2017-03-03,560975,Brian,"I spent a couple nights here on the front end of weeklong ski trip.  The location is fantastic.  There are plenty of food & drink options within walking distance in LoHi, and it's a very short commute to RiNo or downtown.  I had a large-ish rental car which easily found space to park on the street in front of the house each day.

The bed is huge, and the bathroom is huge.  The combination will supercharge your mornings.

Jackie was quick to respond and very thorough in her communication.  I really enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend to others who are spending a few nights in town."
21725586,215426674,2017-11-29,159603170,Jordan,"This was easily one of the best airbnbs I've stayed at. Frank is a great host who is friendly, outgoing, worked around my unusual hours for check-in, and made me feel right at home. The house was extremely cool and Frank knew the history of the neighborhood which was super interesting to hear. Spotless room/bathroom coupled with the comfortable bed made for a fantastic stay. The house is located about a 10-minute drive from downtown and very close to the highway making it very convenient to get anywhere in the city. The next time I'm in town I will try to stay here again- thanks Frank!"

34252983,495276032,2019-07-25,150496057,Danica,"Naiely's space was super cute and clean! It was convenient for reaching RiNo/downtown and also hopping on the highway to the mountains. Parking and check-in/out were a breeze. Beds were extremely comfortable and clean. Lots of thoughtful storage spaces provided. Naiely was quick and helpful with responses. Take note that the building pictured is in fact two homes in one and that this ""guest suite"" is separated from the main home by a single door, which looked to be a sliding barn door. Guest access is on the left and owner's access is on the right. It made me somewhat cautious when I realized only upon entering that the separation between the two spaces was not more finite. I could have read about this more, because I thought it was a separate small building on their lot and have never stayed in an AirBNB that was super shared like this. That being said, I only ever heard someone on the other side once in three days, and they were super quite. The rooms also have curtain rods, but no curtains. The rooms get pretty bright and a little warm in the morning. Although, with the super nice beds, I always went right back to sleep!"
11722154,88537843,2016-07-24,50326029,Andrea,This was my first experience with Airbnb and I was very pleased. AJ was a great host and we really enjoyed our stay in Denver. The house is in a great location.

21189932,332565453,2018-10-05,109371522,Scharla,"This place really is a must stay if you are in the Denver area. This historic building has been turned into an artistic space that has all the comforts of home. We had so much fun looking at all the decor, art on the walls,  and interesting collection of books. The outdoor space was amazing at night with the fire pit and each morning we woke up in a comfortable bed with natural light streaming through the ceiling. The space was close to the RiNo district of Denver which is full of breweries, galleries and fun places to explore. My husband and I treated ourselves to a 90 minute couples  massage at Lodo, which I highly recommend. We would stay here again when visiting Denver! Thank you to our hosts."
6373869,102285482,2016-09-17,44935066,Anna,"Ryan's home was warm and welcoming. It looked exactly like the photos and was very, very clean.

2968873,29314174,2015-04-06,27285505,Mark,"Kevin's place was very clean, with plenty of space for three of us. We were in town to visit breweries, and the apartment was central to most of the places we wanted to go. Had a great balcony with a view and plenty of amenities. Kevin was very helpful and answered all of our questions. Parking was a little sparse outside, but the great location made up for it. Would definitely stay again. "

It's situated in a nice and quiet neighborhood yet really close to walking to downtown attractions and/or only ~$5 ride-share to them. The hospitality touches are really appreciated. Easy check-in and out and prompt, clear communication."
12890649,256460782,2018-04-22,12790777,Benjamin,Great place for a friends get-together. Twelve of us had a great long weekend in denver. Perfect standards for a group of guys like us.  Wish we used backyard more. Cecilia was great for us and our check-in.
14992777,350638055,2018-11-19,223916181,Katie,Our room was clean and cozy. Only struggle was sharing the bathroom with three others.

15766497,147762405,2017-04-28,111417194,Emily,"Jacob's place was exactly what we were looking for for a weekend stay in Denver. It's located close enough to the city so everywhere we wanted to go was only a $5-$6 uber ride away, but far away enough so we didn't worry about ""nightlife noise."" Easy to find and access, Wi-Fi was strong. Jacob was even kind enough to let us keep our luggage there after checkout so we could go see the city some more, because our plane didnt leave for another 4 hours. The only downside was that the toilet was clogged when we arrived and Jacob was out if town so we didn't have a toilet. Thankfully we spent 90% of the time exploring Denver so we didn't have to worry about it. Also, amenities listed were a little different than what we got. No breakfast, just coffee. No ironing board or iron. But despite this, a good stay.  I just hope the toilet got fixed before anyone else checked in."
35341541,517661483,2019-08-25,111399599,Madelin,"Good place to stay. It's clean and a fairly large space. There's street parking right outside, but not a ton  of things super close. We walked to Avanti and a brewery nearby though."

Their son greeted us and let us know where to park, and the best way to get where we were headed that evening. The apartment itself was exactly as described. There was coffee available, clean linens and towels, and extra toiletries in case we'd forgotten anything. The neighborhood was in a great location, only a short drive downtown, a few blocks to the beautiful Sloan's lake, and super friendly neighbors. Being dog-friendly was a must for us, and this was the perfect place within our budget to explore Denver! Very pleased, and hope to stay there again on our next trip!"

We were able to grab cheap Ubers from the house out to different parts of the city. House comfortably fit 5 people. There's a huge tv and plenty of couch room to hang out and also a huge dinning room table for group dinners. There's two bathrooms which each have a shower which made getting ready easy. There's a driveway in the back where you can park a car."

Check in process was super easy despite we arrived very late at night. The next day Chuck came down and gave us a quick orientation of the house. We got to use jacuzzi which was nice. Near by park called “inspiration point” was also nice. The bed is comfy, the place is clean, the kitchen is well stocked. Short drive to nice restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place. "

Billy and Julie have created a very comfortable space with a gorgeous backyard to enjoy in the nice Colorado summer weather.  My husband and I really enjoyed the walkability of this neighborhood, especially traveling with our 2 year old son. The park, Nature and Science Museum, zoo, and restaurants were all just minutes away.  The garage space was a great addition as we were able to safely store our bicycles and additional outdoor gear.
All around, a great location and experience.  I highly recommend it to other travelers looking for a prime location in Denver.  "

Updated kitchen is really nice. Great water pressure (seems random, but I really appreciated it!). Bed is super comfy. Definitely took advantage of the provided snacks!"
18754423,255805792,2018-04-21,85290663,Justin,"This place is fantastic. It's well-kept, new, not far from downtown, and overall a very comfortable place to stay. The only downside might be the amount of stairs you have to climb throughout it (one flight up to the living room/kitchen level, another up to the bedrooms, and then one up to the roof). If this isn't an issue for you, then this place will probably be absolutely perfect. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Private full bathrooms inside 2 of the 3 bedrooms (the other bathroom is just outside the door of the 3rd bedroom). The outside patio is very peaceful and quiet. Our family had a great experience in this home. The pictures do not do the home justice. I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Denver. If we ever visit again, I would strongly consider this home!"

I highly recommend if you’re looking for a quiet space to come home to after a day of venturing out."

13141932,318328081,2018-09-03,61369063,Liz,"As soon as you enter the front gate around to the back to enter the home, your jaw is dropped, amazed and wondering where you are. Fruit and veggies growing everywhere, the sound of a fresh water stream from next door, and then the outdoor furniture to allow you to enjoy that gorgeous space. It doesn’t stop there. You walk through the house and you think, this isn’t a vacation home. This is a dream home! We were supplied with more than a towel per guest and soap because this was evidently a home the owner occupied with everything anyone ever needs. We were a group of 9 and our stay was great. We hope to be back one day."

The neighborhood was wonderful for being able to take walks to get food, coffee or just enjoy the weather. We also took her 6-month picture in the back yard in the garden area:) The available pack and play Cory provided was also hugely helpful! Communication from Cory made it SUPER easy to check in & out too, which was much appreciated. Thanks again!"

The room downstairs is cozy but the whole downstairs is available to use so plenty of space to stretch out. The backyard is wonderful and perfect to enjoy a glass or two of wine. A handful of delicious restaurants are in close proximity. Great place!  Wonderful host!"
16066443,355789755,2018-12-05,93775985,Devon,"Great spot, a short five-minute Uber from downtown, with food and other options walking distance. Highly recommend!"
5794938,156651712,2017-05-31,29830946,Chris,A great stay! Apartment was immaculate and stocked with everything you need and more. Great location too! It was exactly what we expected. 
17556772,152055373,2017-05-14,128791809,Alicia,"This Air BnB was wonderful. Very clean and spacious. Fairly quiet- you could hear faint noises from the owners on the floor above but it was minimal. The furniture was clean and comfortable. All basic kitchen essentials and then some were provided. The owners weee quick to answer questions and help us however they could. We would definitely stay again. The only thing to be sure you know is that the listing says two bedroom, but one of the bedrooms is part of the living room with no separation. The second bedroom has to be walked through to get to the bathroom and kitchen. We made it work with four people but it was different that expected. The only issue was trying not to take the person in the second bedroom if someone had to go to the bthroom or get water At night. "
2441525,18889833,2014-09-02,6504983,Pam,"House was clean and comfortable as described. We didn't meet Juan but everything was handled online and was easy to get in once we got there. House is well furnished with most everythingthing you need. Queen bed is very comfortable, house was very clean. Off street parking was shared with renters downstairs or renters in converted garage, but plenty of off street parking was always available. Neighbor hood is quiet and very pleasant with easy access by bike to downtown, Tennyson, 32nd, 38th, and all of Highlands. Loved hanging out on the front porch in the morning and evening. Only minor problem was MJ smells coming from downstairs in evening. Seems to be common with a lot places I've stayed in Denver since the law changed. Wasn't horrible, and don't really care except for smell."
25634687,475761507,2019-06-24,130792362,Rebekah,"The bedroom and bathroom were spotless and beautiful. There was a nice touch of twinkle lights on the headboard. Their rooftop patio is also very nice. The dog was super cute as well. 

The space was comfortable, but the bed was too firm for me. I need a medium support, and this was definitely firm (not even a medium-firm), even with the 2in topper. 

The location is so close to downtown and was just a few minutes away from my conference venue, which was great."
15602226,276743365,2018-06-14,188594196,G.,Lovely stay
1594161,27114220,2015-02-25,25521629,Billy,Brian and Tarryn are a wonderful couple with a wonderful home. They were super nice and accommodating. The guest arrangements offer a private and peaceful environment. I would highly recommend to anyone coming to Denver.

18306843,462084178,2019-06-01,242836382,Liliana,"This space is awesome! You can tell a lot of thought was put into what you could possibly need as there’s a lot of touches in the room such as: drinks and snacks, extra towels, sheets, sunscreen, bandaids, etc. Tony was a very good communicator and even helped my boyfriend (now fiancé) with locations and the setup of our dinner reservation where he proposed!!! The location was a small walk from everything but there’s restaurants and bars very close by. We will definitely be back!"
26261457,465883878,2019-06-08,70069239,David,"Place was nice and cozy, neighborhood was quiet, and Gina responds pretty fast to messages!"
30525465,448016156,2019-05-04,163296251,Mike,"Centrally located condo just blocks away from anything you'd want: restaurants, bars, CVS, Walgreens, Target, movie theaters, etc, etc. Public transit is simple to use. Light Rail, Cars2Go, Uber and Lyft are plentiful. We had a car since we were spending a month there house-hunting, but one is generally not needed. Mountain and city views are very nice and the building has great amenities. It's also across the street from the Performing Arts Center and Convention Center so lots going on."
19983083,230722063,2018-01-28,166077074,Armaan,Teagan was great as a host! Super accommodating and very easy to reach if we had questions! The place was great and stylish. I would however say that the bed would be a little tight for 2 people but it was totally fine and we made it work. Honey Bear was a little shy at first but was extremely welcoming to us! The area is great but has a wide diverse range of houses around it as a growing area. Easy to Uber/Lyft anywhere in the city.
24644409,272649594,2018-06-03,190182467,Tamar,"Cruz is a super excellent host! He was able to meet up with us early, and was highly accommodating. 

He has really great tips for checking out the real Denver, so if you’re a tourist, top spot. 

He keeps his place awesomely decorated, stocked with food and drinks, and will even offer to pick something up at the (very conveniently located) Trader Joe’s for you. He even has some spare toiletries if you forget something of that ilk.

Could not recommend this guy and his place enough. "
11789571,141917223,2017-04-05,67813662,Kevin,"Excellent accommodations, would work for singles through small families. Easy walking to food. Quaint, quiet neighborhood with some small shops."

7557038,548097870,2019-10-16,53973418,Brenton,"The carriage house was a great experience and in a perfect location.  I had booked it for a conference because hotel prices were too high, and from what I heard from others, I made a great choice.  Stan offered the same amenities as any hotel in a large, clean space.  The bottle of wine provided was an excellent touch.  Couldn’t be happier with my stay!"
18034478,356298243,2018-12-07,214631402,Gwyn,Sam's place provided an excellent home for us for a week while we visited our son in Denver.  Sam had provided several welcoming treats and was very responsive to any request. We will likely stay again on a future visit.
17185409,325072484,2018-09-18,137487867,Lindsey,"Exactly as described! The perfect place in the middle of everything you could possibly need in Denver. Small and private all in the most perfect way. Oh and as Laura mentioned in the bio about her dog barking - he didn’t bark once, but greeted us at the window every time. :) Adorable dog! We’ll be back Laura, thanks again!"
35734859,521185936,2019-08-31,32707487,Meryl,Great place to crash for the night if you have a late flight into DIA and don't want to trek to the city.

Lori's space is beautiful!  Perfect location, with easy on street parking, and a great spot to relax in. 


We were in Denver for a few days for an Avs game and Lori's spot was perfect!! 

I would absolutely recommend her space.."

The AirBnB has everything you would need to have a comfortable stay, and it is very clean with new amenities. It is a great place for an individual or small group of friends who need a relaxing place to stay during their trip."

13474217,456077314,2019-05-20,135866139,Brian,Kinga was very responsive and helpful!! Good location within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Never had to wait for a Lyft to places that were out of walking distance. Would suggest more guests (there were only three of us) because it is a large place with room for 5-6!
16861201,280598396,2018-06-23,170458598,Jillian,"Gabriela's place was wonderful! It was very clean, and had lots of homey touches. She was a kind and hospitable host, and even brought me some ginger ale and crackers when I was sick from the altitude! PERFECT location near downtown, while still having available parking and a quiet neighborhood. Definitely will be staying with her next time I'm in Denver!"

I enjoyed a lot my stay at his cosy and well-equipped place (iron, coffee, cable TV, good tips about food shops in the surroundings...). Thank you!"
5956309,200827056,2017-10-06,135048430,Ben,"I didn't get to meet Alex over the course of my three day stay, but check in was smooth and communication was good throughout. Despite us being complete strangers he also did me a couple favours - which was nice. The room was very comfortable and exactly what I needed.

The house is in a great spot in a lovely quiet area, it was nice just to chill out and sit on the porch out front occasionally. The cafe across the street is also a great place to hang out. Lots of cool bars and places to eat nearby on Larimer street and downtown is walkable or a cheap uber away - lots to see and do there.

I'd definitely stay there again."
22328145,257048431,2018-04-24,118035166,Calman,Great space. Clean. Thank you.
3992779,75168242,2016-05-19,63773875,Margaret,"Elizabeth was an excellent host - everything in the apartment is as described in the listing. Elizabeth was so sweet and welcoming and even left us some coffee and great tasting beer! Her guidebook provided excellent recommendations too. Her place was centrally located, and within walking distance or a short Uber ride to many places in Denver. Her place is perfect for two people and I would definitely recommended staying at her place! Plus, her dogs are adorable :)"

It was the perfect place to stay in for a quick sleep before heading to the airport in the morning!! I would definitely book this home again."
28581318,468962116,2019-06-13,155963335,Keith And Susan,"This place is amazing! Squeaky clean, beautifully decorated, excellent location. Juli-Rachel is an excellent host - friendly, responsive, helpful. We've stayed at a lot of airbnb's and this place is at the top of our list!"

The house is in a fairly new area, so everything felt new and stylish! Zaid and Nagris were really welcoming and happy to chat - great hosts! All in all a lovely start to my first trip to the US!"
17530389,143612236,2017-04-12,105926064,Lauren,"Our stay was, in one word, AMAZING!  Marcus and Holly are incredible hosts.  They were home with us for most of the week.  We spent time chatting a bit, but they were great about giving us space...felt like we had the place to ourselves.  They were also super helpful and provided us with a list of their favorite spots around the city! 

The apartment is lovely...clean and cozy!  It is a short walk (about 5 blocks) to Broadway which has a ton of restaurants and bars and maybe 15-20 minute walk to the rail station.  Convenient to get into the heart of the city (5 stops maybe...?) but also tucked in jussssst far enough that you are in a quiet residential neighborhood if you want to sleep in/go to bed early.

We loved it!!!!"
30508140,434791318,2019-04-08,186232488,Michael,Perfect location to explore Denver and be within a short driving distance to hike the mountains. Cozy and quiet space with easy access to everything. Great hosts who make sure you have what you want and what you need.
15766497,453730061,2019-05-16,11057643,Eli,Very good location near RiNo and all of its breweries and restaurants. Easy to get in and out and a public parking lot right across the street that always had spots available
30759386,522829282,2019-09-02,67213619,Katy,"In addition to the accommodations being clean and comfortable, Amelia was a tremendous host!!! Although we never saw her, she made sure we had everything we needed and quickly responded with questions or if we needed local recommendations. The space was perfect for our group of 3, but any more guests and the space would have been a little too small. While the location was close to so much, we did find that having a rental car made getting around the big city much easier! If ever traveling to Denver again, we wouldn't think twice about staying with Amelia again!"
7817254,211667267,2017-11-13,27711816,Ashley,Love Will and Mary!!! Was super helpful and nice. Will definitely stay again.

13744375,165652118,2017-07-01,36844930,Tress,The location was close enough to downtown and shopping without having to deal with traffic. It is located near the Cherry Creek Mall.

26562549,306584331,2018-08-12,191881322,Mark,"If you are looking for a premium spot right in the heart of LoHi, this is the place.  We had 6 and it was just the right amount of room without feeling crowded.  Beds were very comfortable, which is a must have for me, and the place was very clean. Jay is an excellent host and very responsive and I would highly recommend his place."

28609607,478295457,2019-06-29,101252885,Sarah,"Megan's house is in a such great location. We walked to and had dinner on Pearl Street two nights out of three and also walked over to Broadway for some funky antique shops and bars. We enjoyed afternoon cocktails on the front porch while people-watching and we would have totally used the back porch, with string lights and a fire pit, if we had had more time. The basement and basement bathroom are awesome extra space to have, even though we never broke in the ping-pong table it was nice to know it was there. . The entire space was clean and well-maintained and we loved her decor and artwork. Megan was very easy to communicate with and we would definitely stay here again."

Days before the check in they made sure to reach out and touch base about the check in procedure. They could not have made their place any more accommodating! The place is designed as your own private get away. The suite was incredibly clean, well maintained and had the extra touches you didn’t realize you needed while being away from home. The hot tub was amazing and THE FLOORS IN THE BATHROOM ARE HEATED (a luxury everyone should experience at least once). We would absolutely love to stay here again!!"

Overall very happy with my stay there. It's my pleasure to meet you nice people! Many thanks :)"

Fully equiped with everything that we needed for a one night stop over in Denver. Friendly hostess and two lovely dogs which we met just as we were leaving. McKenna also recommended the Stowaway cafe for breakfast and we really enjoyed their delicious food and coffee. Thanks for everything. Maria"
7663335,523058715,2019-09-02,268653867,Travis,"We had a great time at John’s. The only heads I’d give is that there’s not central heating or air. The homeless in the area was shockingly large, but they didn’t bother us and we didn’t bother them. Other then that, just be prepared to spend a good amount on Uber rides! Over all, it was a great experience. I would recommend it."
3458369,317160247,2018-09-01,191888,Josie,"The pictures don’t do it justice. This carriage house is so cool and right in the heart of the best shops and restaurants in Highlands, while managing to feel peaceful/secluded. Jamie was very responsive, provided us with thoughtful extras for our little one (a pack n play + high chair), and made such a great dinner rec we went two nights in a row. Don’t miss this gem."

The mattress was a memory foam one and it felt like sleeping on cloud. I don't know where he gets his pillows, but it feels like laying your head on a marshmallow. The shower has a rock floor and it is like being at a spa. Neil is such a respectful host; he gives you your privacy, but he is also available whenever you need him. I am glad I chose to stay at Neil's! I hope next time I am in Denver I can stay at Neil's, because it was the best!"

She also has a sick roof! If that’s not enough, Morgan and her husband are extremely laid back and sweet! Stay here."
31989746,413642251,2019-02-17,160216525,Ireland,This place was the perfect location to uber into downtown but also not be staying down town. There were other people staying in the other room when we were there which I was unaware of but we never had any conflict with that situation. All in all it was a perfect place to stay.
861993,355322938,2018-12-03,117159898,Stephanie,"John and Shann's place is in a wonderful location, super close to everything but still in a quiet suburb.  It was a perfect landing spot after a day outdoors or downtown.  Many good things to say about this experience!"

34306107,467609984,2019-06-10,21656041,Amanda,"Our stay was wonderful. The beds were comfy and there was plenty of towels and blankets for everyone. There is no TV or kitchen just a mini fridge and microwave, but it worked for us since we were only there for a long weekend and planned on eating/staying out all day. The house is very close to the Rino district and downtown Denver. We used uber/lyft a lot."

19449063,479871975,2019-07-01,34791272,Allison,"The Baxter Mansion was perfect for our party of 4 adults, 5 kids and 2 dogs. The fenced backyard was especially great for the pets. The house was beautiful and spacious, exactly as described. Location was terrific. Ashley was a great host, very responsive and accommodating."
33319580,522240379,2019-09-01,156107423,Tara,Great place pretty close to downtown.  Having a private entrance and the recent renovations really made the place feel like our own. Jeremy had several tips for us and was a really nice guy and communication was very easy.

The location is very walkable, we loved being near Voodoo donuts and Watercourse! Some noise through the night but nothing you wouldn’t expect staying in the city. "

7562368,150297529,2017-05-07,114544218,Cassandra,"The house is exactly as it is depicted...we had such a lovely stay there. The house was great, clean and comfortable, great amenities, the beds were comfy, and I can't say enough good things about the location! So many good restaurants within walking distance! I would definitely recommend this place! We didn't have small children with us, but this is a very family friendly neighborhood with a park only a block away."
21435378,331068583,2018-10-01,13647118,Eugene,It was my 3rd time staying at Matt’s property and he made it just as good and easy as the last 2 times i stayed there. Matt is super good with communications especially so those who want good communication will love his hospitality. Highly recommend for people who are looking for a place to stay close to downtown in Denver.
33717500,548035947,2019-10-16,30107023,Tony,"This was a great family stop, not far from Denver Museum and Zoo at City Park (but still a short drive distance). Offering was very clean. Beds were very comfortable. Internet is very strong. Bring your devices to keep kids occupied.  A small fridge, microwave and coffee maker are available for snacks and getting started in the morning. Very gentrified and safe neighborhood. We'd do it again."

22884861,242307614,2018-03-11,42710501,Alexandra,"I had a great stay! The place was clean and spacious, and had a binder of restaurants and attractions nearby. I live in Boulder and I didn't even know about some of the things in there. We checked out one of the suggested restaurants and it was delicious. One thing to be aware of is that there are neighbors across the hall, which is only about 4 feet wide. In my case, me and a friend came home from a concert somewhat late and were nervous about making too much noise because it's so close. But besides that, we had a great stay. Thanks Chris!"
22482779,546606992,2019-10-13,40153458,Elise,"The carriage house was great. Super clean and in a great location. Definitely would stay here again! Thank you, Marissa!"

10244515,543880640,2019-10-08,6238024,Kayla,"Loved my stay at Scott & Debra’s place. It was very spacious, super cute, and had everything you’d need to cook & be comfortable. My favorite touch was the pumpkin patch & fresh veggies in the back yard. Their house is also a short walk or drive to several beautiful parks, coffee shops & restaurants, and it’s easy to park right out front whenever you return. Would definitely recommend their place to anyone visiting Denver!"
19950732,208054784,2017-10-30,149327305,Bryan,"Cute space in a cute neighborhood! Getting around was fairly easy with Broadway about a 10 minute walk away. Comfortable home, we would definitely recommend this place."
3917345,76450469,2016-05-27,51611154,James,"Jiah provides a great vacation retreat. Remember to remove your shoes once inside the dwelling. Coffee is readily available, although I recommend going to ""mmm.. coffee"" for their bulletproof brew. If you're talI, you may find the desk area under the bunk bed to be snug. I definitely hope to stay there again in the future."
26029313,350631296,2018-11-19,46223804,Paulina,Highly Recommend.  Great place with everything you need.
27271600,422696103,2019-03-11,188608928,Tom,"Michael's place suited our needs perfectly for a quick stay in Denver before heading to the mountains.  The space was welcoming with an updated style and appliances.  Although it can definitely sleep 4, it might be a little tight space wise if you have a lot of luggage (i.e. ski equipment).

It was a little challenging to find the place despite Michael's extra details because (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps got confused. Highly recommend putting in the main address and actually looking at a map to find the appropriate entrance."
11241369,168611876,2017-07-09,89035525,Michelle,"This house was great for our group of 7, plenty of space so we never felt like we were on top of each other. Great location, close to great restaurants and the mountains. Would definitely recommend it!"
21459839,311163984,2018-08-20,3635260,Jenny,Very clean and spacious. The rooftop deck was a great place to hang out. Perfect for 6-10 people to sleep comfortably.
23769761,462091614,2019-06-01,327763,Jennifer,"Carol's place is beautiful! The rooftop deck is a special treat with a great view. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay close to downtown. Our group was in for a work conference and some fun during downtime. It was great to have a kitchen, living room and separate bedrooms/baths instead of sharing a hotel room. 

Two things to note about this AirBnb: 1) The bathroom on the 2nd floor is a half-bath that is in the kitchen/living area. Guests staying in the 2nd floor bedroom will need to go up to the 3rd floor to shower in one of the private bathrooms/accessible only by entering the bedrooms on this level. 2) Clearer check-in instructions are needed. I gave the host suggested check-in instructions for future renters. Carol is super responsive and checks in often with her guests so I am sure this won't be an issue for future renters."
8084258,51869273,2015-10-24,31380725,Edwin,Just as pictured.... Perfect little spot for the weekend!
8718728,127207048,2017-01-16,74884396,Rasha,"Rachel's home has this very earthy humble vibe to it, and it was such a welcoming experience coming from the busy east coast that I'm from. Her home is in a quiet neighborhood but it's conveniently close to downtown Denver, breweries and food spots (like a 10min drive max). Rachel and her roommates are very welcoming and come with a lot of suggestions based on what you want to do! It was a good weekend at her place! "
25457378,463032921,2019-06-02,110494926,Amy,Wonderful with lots of room! We felt very at home in this space. It was close to so many fun places which made it easy to check out Denver. Don’t hesitate booking!

2467260,101850078,2016-09-15,14793883,Chris,"What a charming, lovely spot! Located off a quiet street near and just about everything in the city. Ryan was responsive and helpful throughout the process. I would highly recommend a stay here."

13745963,285087395,2018-07-02,55266007,Ana,Check-in was clear and the apartment is in a quiet neighborhood. Parking on the street was no problem and the apartment itself is very quiet. Communication with Caleb was very responsive. We had no trouble fitting four people comfortably and in the summer it can get a little humid with one bathroom. I would stay here again on the next trip to Denver!

21849976,493613272,2019-07-22,16529231,Rebecca,"Cozy, homey place with comfy common area and sparkling clean bathroom. Only thing that disappointed me was that the room smelled faintly of cigarette smoke. Not sure if that’s because of prior guest had smoked in there, or what? On the plus side, the host was very accessible and immediately available to help me when I had a little trouble getting in. All told, I would definitely stay again."
18331882,555573658,2019-10-27,2315620,John,"Exactly as advertised.  Historic and lively location.  Apartment is exceptionally clean.  Communication and check in were very smooth. Great space, very homey.  Would recommend and stay again."

The place was immaculately clean and contemporary and very secluded. I would most certainly look him up again the next time I am in town! Do it!
30253093,545578065,2019-10-12,105245413,Shanon & Joel,"Dan has put a lot of pride and time into his home and his Airbnb guests.
The deco is chicvand new. He has house plants that are so healthy that they help add a calmness to the atmospere.  The bedrooms have storage space and great little touches to add to your comfort. 
Dan offers all the amenities you could want. Full kitchen, bathroom, laundry and a great backyard and porch. Some of the porch is covered and to the side are some chairs with a nice little firepit. There's is also a nice little front porch with a bench. 
Check in and out are a breeze. The location is right by 2 bus stops within a couple of blocks. There are bars and resturants within a mile. Definitely walking distance.  There is a grocery store within a mile and a half. And downtown is about 5 minutes away by car and short bus ride. 
Dam is alsovery friendly and helpful.

The apartment was really clean and the bed was super comfortable, which made for a great stay for us after long days of exploring the city & surrounding area. Parking on the street was very easy and the apartment was located near major highways, so we had no problem taking day trips and finding parking for our rental car when we returned. Beth and David also sent along some great recommendations and were very responsive to questions.  We would definitely be glad to stay here again on a return trip to Denver!"

Every amenity you could think of was provided and Jason was easy to get a hold of whenever we had questions! There are some great restaurants within walking distance as well as a few bars with great night life! If for whatever reason you didn't want to walk downtown (less than a mile walk), there is a bus just a few hundred feet from the place you can easily hop on! The location, value and comfort of this place was unbeatable! Our only regret was that we could not stay longer! We will definitely stay here on our next adventure in Denver! Thank you Jason! "
17303217,258159873,2018-04-28,51927025,Michael,"Perfect home stay for the two of us.   Nicely renovated home, some great design touch and details, nicer than most hotels you would stay in.  Perfectly clean, plenty of room.    Very much appreciated the coffee pods, fresh fruit, snacks and water bottles, and the basics in the pantry for cooking.

Excellent location just a few blocks from I-25 making it easy to get anyway, downtown in 20 mins most days.

Thanks very much!"

5347637,46274493,2015-09-09,36668495,Susan,"My husband and I had such a great time at Greg's place.  The accommodations were wonderful and the bed was so comfortable!  During our stay, the shower doors needed to be replaced, and Greg did everything he could to accommodate us while the shower was unusable.  When we arrived, we found a list of local bars, restaurants, and attractions which was so helpful for our stay.  We will definitely be visiting again if we are in the area!"

They give you a set of dishs and silverware.  They even have designated spaces in the refrigerator and in the cupboards for your food. They have a good set of pots and pans and a block knife set. 
Overall our stay was very nice and went smoothly. I would recommend and start here again."

As Jay described, it is very small. If you have more than a couple pieces of luggage it would be tight. 

Overall very happy with this Airbnb!"

Parking can be difficult, as there is only street spots available and it’s is a busy area. Plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance if you want to stay local! Super accommodating hosts, let us keep our bikes secure while we did a few things in the city. Highly recommend! "

Great restaurants & bars nearby plus 2 dispensaries 1 block away. Definitely need to be 420 friendly as the place smelt strongly, but that wasn’t a problem with us. Huge lake down the road which was great to walk around - we would all stay again"

There are a couple of excellent cafes nearby for coffee and possibly tasty taco shops. The lower level is super private and quiet in a very modern town home.   It's best served by car, ride share, or bike.  For a newbie host, Steph is off to a great start!"

He gave us great recommendations in the neighborhood, check-in was a breeze. The home itself is clean and home-y. Stan provides basic toiletries you don't typically get at AirBnbs and even left a few treats for us upon arrival. The neighborhood is pretty quiet (which we enjoyed), and some great restaurant options within walking distance. Thank you, Stan!"

Perfect for 2 or 4 guest. The beds were comfy and I was surprised the living room TV had cable ! Our favorite part was the rooftop with the beautiful city view.  Great if you need a moment to breath. 

Leah was a great host and responded quickly to any questions or needs!

9462238,255834168,2018-04-21,66787579,Fredrick,Eric was a wonderful host. He stayed in touch and communicated with quick responses before and while staying at his place. I didn't have any problems with my room or getting in and out of the house. He provided me with keys so that I could reenter the house at my convenience. He filled me in on the hot spots to check out in Denver and also offered advice on the best ways to move about his city. He even had some  bud for me that saved me from making an immediate stop at the dispensary.  His Brita Water Filter provided me with the best tap water Ive ever tasted.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely consider staying at his place again when I return to Denver.

24746875,328588103,2018-09-26,849611,Kari,"Zach's place was perfect for our group of three (and I can easily see it fitting more)! 

Seamless communication before, during and after the trip made for a totally  stress-free arrangement. 

The entire apartment was clean, stylish and relaxing. The outdoor space is gorgeous and was an awesome spot to decompress.

The beds (and couch!) are suuuuper comfortable, and were perfect for plopping down on after a long day of hiking...or drinking... 

The location is great, parking wasn't an issue. 

Would definitely book again whenever in Denver next! Can't recommend more!"

We especially LOVED the decor and all the nice amenities that were laying around for us to use! Nice and quaint, very low-key. We really enjoyed staying here while visiting Denver. Would definitely pick this place again! :) "
6921688,288423056,2018-07-09,7532319,Rosemerry,"It is our third time staying at Book Bed. I almost hate to tell you how wonderful it is so that it isn't always booked when I want to go! But the truth is it's beyond wonderful, especially if you are a word person. The decor is meant for word and book lovers. And you're atop a top notch bookstore, beware your pocket book! And there is a wonderful lending library in the unit, plus another outside the front door of Book Bar. It's modern and cozy and has absolutely everything you'd need ... we made our own meals most of the time and appreciate the small patio, the great wifi, the fully equipped kitchen, the choice of pillows, the comfy bed, the uncluttered feel, the central location. It's bliss. "

They made it feel just like home and we loved the note with a list of their favorite places nearby. The location is perfect to explore The city, quiet neighborhood but still more than enough within walking distance. I would absolutely stay again and recommend it to anyone I know. "
32564069,502590231,2019-08-04,265150258,Tony,"Stayed at the house for a bachelor party (12 of us).  Big house, plenty of room and sleeping space. Pretty good location, Uber rides to the stadium and rino district were cheap and quick. We were able to take scooters pretty much anywhere we wanted, highly recommend those. Very satisfied with our stay."

The pictures don't do the space justice; it's absolutely lovely - cozy, charming, and quiet.  There's a beautiful, shaded garden for sitting outside and it's location is within walking distance of many little shops and restaurants.  It's just a block away from a main corridor and only maybe half a mile to the freeway (I25).  A very short drive or a healthy walk gets you to the Broncos' stadium.  There's a lovely park, a library, a drug store, and a grocery store close at hand and the bus system can be accessed very easily.  We would absolutely stay here again and recommend these accommodations without reservation!  We miss being there already!"
19518864,275238652,2018-06-10,72423827,Christina,Tess and Jack are wonderful hosts. Their home was spotless and had everything needed to make our stay comfortable and easy. The rooftop was perfect for morning coffee and cocktails at sundown!
4727890,47330816,2015-09-17,43290882,Savanna,"This apartment is RAD! 
We had no clue there was going to be a trampoline, hammock, and couch swing in the backyard, which just added to our delight. The yard is slightly overgrown but honestly I thought it just added to the charm. 

Tony was out of town but was easy to get in contact with and answered my messages promptly. The space is small but open and really made our stay in Denver a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Also, I didn't realize how close it is to the artist district, which was a huge plus. Restaurants and galleries are just about a block away and the whole area has great character. We did NOT want to leave."

16087125,429658843,2019-03-28,25266478,Yerika,"Book this place RIGHT NOW. Very spacious upper floor apartment. I stayed in Julie’s with my husband and our children age 7,5 and 2. It felt like a home away from home. You enter through a private door and you can park right in front. Separate living and dining room with very elegant little touches. A fireplace and cozy couches. Clean bathroom with modern vanity and a bathtub. Second bedroom with its own closet space. Master bedroom with access to a very quaint outdoor patio. Central heating and you can control the temperature yourself. Very comfortable base for a Denver trip. Amenities are amazing you only need to bring your clothes and your toothbrush. My children love this place so much.. i could stay in all day and just read the books Julie has in this apartment. Welcome snacks is a nice touch. Everything is sparkling clean even all the plates inside the cupboard. Will stay here again for sure!! Thank you Julie you are so sweet too! (We met her before we left) <3"

As his first guest, I can report that he was very nice throughout our communication and his check in instructions were simple to follow. His studio is a wonderful space and has great natural light. Wether you’re traveling alone, or as a couple, this studio is the perfect size. Finally, I did not make it up to the roof, but Bobby says the view is gorgeous, so please, go to the roof and enjoy colorful Colorado. :)"

We were able to walk to the Rockies game, Union Station, the Denver Central Market and 16th St. Mall. From the Mall, it's easy to jump on the free bus and take it to many museums and other other interesting areas. The continental breakfast that's included was perfect for us...scones, muffins, Kind bars, kombucha, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea and we enjoyed being able to eat it outside on the porch. We used the comfortable common area to hang our with our son for while we waited for others to meet us for dinner."

1035821,486475978,2019-07-12,174097644,Jordan,Great location. Within walking distance or a short Uber ride to a lot of places. You probably won’t be able to find a better value for the location and space that this house provides in Denver.
13751968,262696664,2018-05-09,8699850,Tonya,Very awesome place to stay! Parking was a little bit of an issue but what can you expect when you're so close to everything Denver has to offer?? We definitely loved staying at this apartment
25475743,453755577,2019-05-16,259578616,Shawna,Loved how quick they were to respond and help with any of our needs. The bedroom was comfortable. And we slept amazing.
16548314,197994425,2017-09-27,10034355,Jordan,"I must admit, that when first driving up on this place, I was a bit sceptical. However, once getting into the backyard area and seeing this cottage, my concerns were alleviated. This backyard cottage is comfortable, large, well decorated and definitely felt very livable. We only stayed for one night but would definitely recommend it. Tomas was also very friendly and helpful with the check in process."
861993,122023428,2016-12-20,25694696,Ben,John and shann's place was perfect for our stay. It was super comfy and a very easy going. Nice and close to send twn Denver.
27432059,359350970,2018-12-16,67035979,Connie,If you want to be close to downtown with a nice place to stay this was great.  Plenty of room for the 4 of us to be in for a long weekend and close to where we needed to be.
1733052,213381128,2017-11-20,54551154,Laurel,Great location! Awesome family!
15844892,535558067,2019-09-24,23781313,Allison,"Daniel's place was absolutely amazing! Every detail was just perfect from the size of the place, decor details in each room, and welcome note by the door. Would definitely stay here again!"
29130386,465907490,2019-06-08,83571474,Liv,"This is a very nice space that's very clean and perfect for couples. We wanted to cook our own breakfasts and make snacks and were pleased to fine basic cooking supplies when we needed them. My husband and I live in California currently and wanted to visit Denver because we considered moving there. After our stay we decided we love the city and will be relocating soon. Stetson and Megan kindly provided us with suggestions for areas we should check out to give us a sense of the city. The time we stayed there was quite hot but even though the room is on the second floor, we had no trouble keeping the place cool. We also didn't have to drive far to get around. We didn't get a chance to explore the location by walking, but I found I was happy to have a rental car during our time, mostly because of the heat. Overall we had a great time and would recommend individuals and couples to stay here."
14488549,423577170,2019-03-14,93222396,Shannon,"Wow, what a fun and unique apartment! Easy walking distance to my conference site, bus lines, and many shops/restaurants in the downtown area. I ended up having to unexpectedly extend my stay in Denver because of a snowstorm - Alexandre and Lilli were very kind, and prompt to respond to my communications, which was such a relief during what was a very stressful situation. The film library is amazing, and made being snowbound much more fun than it would have been otherwise!"
32308946,555591551,2019-10-27,14554910,Ryan,"Wonderfully hip and incredible spacious. Walking distance to some very cool spots. Candice, Pearl & Boo Boo were lovely hosts - all the little things added up and made the experience all the more. 

Thank you for the hospitality! 
A & R"
10161676,336856112,2018-10-14,39361818,Susan,Nancy supplied many amenities to make us feel at home. From cream to Laundry to coffee there were many items that we didn’t have to worry about because she had already thought of it.

15844892,360466120,2018-12-20,25343827,Stephen,"We had a great three week stay at Daniel’s place while our place was being remodeled. The apartment is beautiful and had everything we needed. The location is fantastic with Cheesman Park, restaurants and stores just a couple blocks away. As others have noted, you can hear walking and activity in the house above but it wasn’t a problem for us. There isn’t a separate thermostat for the basement but Daniel got me set up on their thermostat app so we could adjust the temperature when needed, which was very helpful on the days that I was working from home. Daniel was very responsive to all communication and requests."
8390543,86904778,2016-07-18,33825646,Justin,Logan was a great host. Immediate responses to questions and very flexible. I would recommend to family and friends. Thanks Logan!

18501266,404604039,2019-01-24,49365532,Virginia,We loved our stay at the Kaleidoscope House! The check-in process was a breeze and Channan had great recommendations for what to do in the neighborhood and for the rest of our time in Colorado! The house was homey and comfortable and we loved the decor! We would definitely recommend the Kaleidoscope House to anyone visiting Denver!
17270985,164248761,2017-06-26,23668730,Caty,"This house was perfect for our group of 8. Everything was clean and comfortable, and Sarah was easy to communicate with before and during our stay.  We really enjoyed what the neighborhood had to offer (nearby City Park, Rosenberg's Bagels, Steuben's) and the close proximity to other hotspots in Denver. Definitely recommend!"
1733052,325408796,2018-09-19,215694888,Katelyn,"Loved the location! Within walking distance to Voodoo donuts and multiple good restaurants! Great updated space with nice touches of little snacks and coffee/tea! 
Enjoyed our short time in Denver!"
25909447,428702399,2019-03-25,245896272,Kolby,"Personally, this was my first time using Airbnb. I was more than impressed with my stay. This house felt like a home away from home. Not only was the house very clean, everything was where you would expect it to be. Jalena had cups in cabinets, body wash and shampoo below the sink, plenty of trash bags and much more! If you’re not sure about staying here, trust me, you definitely should!"
1905596,154088129,2017-05-22,13912931,Jay,"Annette has a beautiful property located in a lovely resudential area within an easy walk to the Tennyson Street area of small shops, art galleries and great little restsurants. Its a two block walk to the bus which brings you to downtown Denver in 25 minutes, or about a $7-9 ride on a shared ride arrangement with Lyft or Uber. Very convenient in a relaxed setting. The Timber Suite in which we stayed is just the ticket for a quiet cozy stay or romantic getaway. The weather was cold, rainy and snowy on the day after we arrived in mid May..... Denver weather changes we were told... and the suite was a welcoming refuge in which to spend the day. Plenty of room, separate bedroom area, nicely furnished and decorated, and a tribute to her late husband's craft and woodworking skills. It was an honor to spend our time there. Annette was a most gracious host, and while out of town, kept in touch via phone and text if we had any needs or questions and her on-premis assistants and friends were able to provide any items we may have needed. They even baked us some delicious brownies to greet us upon our arrival. Without a doubt, Annette's wiil be our go to place when we return to Denver. We made a point of throwing ""Three Dimes for Denver"" into fountain at the Botanical Gardens just to make sure we do!"

25540293,342467315,2018-10-28,41580279,Samantha,This is cozy studio home nearby Denver's  local art/culture scene. Loved heading up the block to the used book store and the amazing coffee each morning at Pablo's. Sydney took care of our check in and check out. Super clean space-with basic amenities  and  kitchen supplies are generously supplied. Sydney is easily available by phone and lives right next door if needed. We enjoyed our stay in this adorable Denver gem!
25549371,477166947,2019-06-27,10914349,Tom,Shelby's place had lots of small touches that I wish more Airbnbs had. I would highly recommend staying here.
7919653,93204547,2016-08-11,58377325,Jo,"Our stay at Colleens beautiful Victorian home was amazing! We were a party of six adults visiting family a few blocks away and the house provided us with a large roomy base from which to explore nearby downtown and the surrounding Colorado countryside.  The location is excellent. There are plenty of local places for dining that are a short walk away and we enjoyed our morning runs finishing up at Einsteins bagels! City park is a short walk away and includes golf courses and a small driving range, lovely walks, the Museum of Nature and Science and free Sunday night concerts - bring a rug and a picnic!
The house is exactly as described, comfortable beds, large showers, 2 bathtubs, well stocked kitchen and a great basement bar! The outside back porch is a lovely area to sit with a drink and the gym/spa is a nice addition. 
Colleen was a great host and at my request emailed me the check in details early before we left the UK, as we were staying in Chicago for the week preceding our visit. She also checked in with us whilst we were there to make sure everything was ok.
We had a fantastic stay and I can't recommend this place highly enough!"
36881170,548027567,2019-10-16,63293395,Drew,Hasena's place is great. Super good value. We had a great time.
10140249,342472943,2018-10-28,155225657,Greenlee,"Angelica’s place was great. If you are looking for a place in a wonderful neighborhood that is walking distance to most anything you need this is the place. We walked to a variety of restaurants each day we were there. There is plenty of a space, a comfortable bed, a nice shower, a full kitchen, and a huge tv setup with Netflix and Amazon Prime. The place was very clean with beautiful hardwood floors. Angelica was quick to answer messages and offer suggestions for restaurants and things to do around Denver. She was a great host. We would definitely stay there again."
21080559,452253524,2019-05-12,16748860,Dusty,"Brad's place was great. Very spacious and comfortable. Communication was quick, check-in was easy, I slept very well in the bed, the shower was great. It had all I needed as I explored Denver. Really close to a good strip of restaurants and things to do, it's very close to interstate so it didn't take long to get places. I had a great stay!"
14828379,519454598,2019-08-28,244137361,Elizabeth,"Great home in nice LoHi neighborhood!  We walked everywhere to great restaurants/bars in the area.  Easy access to the Highland pedestrian bridge and more restaurants, Union Station and walking paths.  As expected the place was clean and well stocked! We spent mornings with coffee  on the patio and it was lovely.  
We didn't cook as we wanted to be out exploring and enjoying all the great restaurants/bars, but if we had wanted to cook there was everything we would need. We had a rental car, and although there was usually street parking, the secured garage was a nice amenity that we took advantage of.
Travis was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to questions!
We would definitely stay here again!"
18227184,293148278,2018-07-19,98533276,Jayan,Nice place with an awesome view of the city. Mathew and Patrick are friendly and I can definitely recommend this place for a single person.

29464543,345717331,2018-11-05,154387183,Judy,"Ann was so easy to deal with and responded quickly to all our questions. The house was: clean, cozy, charming & comfortable. We relaxed a lot and walked to nearby cool shops & restaurants! What a great place in Denver to explore! We had to work a bit and had great WiFi service. We had so much fun but ran out of time as Ann is a licensed Massage Therapist, so we will take advantage of this benefit next time! We had a great time and will be back soon! Thanks for true 5 STAR Service!!:)"

Great for a drink anytime of the day. Union station is a short 30 minute walk. Overall, an excellent home away from home. :)"

13789731,290028548,2018-07-13,22932750,Alison,"A spacious vintage apartment in an up and coming neighborhood. Clean, bright and roomy. Bed was very comfortable and the apartment had lots of charm. Parking was very convenient at the back of the house and the private entrance made coming and going very easy. The location is perfect for getting downtown- less than 10 minutes by car.  There is a unique vegan restaurant close by that we tried and it was a great spot to people watch! Even though there were only 2 of us, there would be plenty of room for 4 people."
21516952,539611547,2019-10-01,92496584,Debra,Super host—great communicator!  Wonderful location and welcomed me and my dog.

4951295,77767042,2016-06-03,56264803,Dawn,"Christiane's apartment is a wonderful space and she was a very welcoming host. The apartment was immaculately clean, stylishly decorated, and very cozy. The neighborhood is awesome - great restaurants just at the end of the block (Il Posto and the Thai restaurant were both fantastic). Easy to get anywhere downtown from this locale. I had a nice run in Cheseman park. Christiane went the extra mile and provided english muffins, milk for my coffee (Nespresso), peanut butter, jam, and cream cheese, fresh apples, and tea. The apartment was well stocked with all your basic toiletry needs including a hair dryer (which was not listed in the description so that was a bonus), towels, etc. The bed was comfortable. Christiane was available yet not overbearing. This felt like a safe space and neighborhood. I would advise that prospective travelers just remember that this is a basement apartment so your expectations should be in line with that - i.e. you can hear the folks and dogs upstairs walking around, talking, etc. but it was not at all bothersome and did not occur late at night or early in the morning. There is a separate entrance for the apartment so you can come and go as you please. Overall, this was a fantastic first experience with Air BNB and I highly recommend Christiane's Urban Nest!  "
769437,8455698,2013-10-31,9645559,Kyle,"This was my first stay using airbnb and I couldn't be more pleased.  Simone and Joel were excellent hosts, and the room was wonderful.  Their home is in the perfect location for exploring Denver and just down the road from the convention center.  Highly recommended!"
9080234,111920027,2016-11-02,2450199,Jill,"We loved everything about Tyler's place! Communication was quick and concise from day one. The house is super easy to get to by foot or car. And the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was perfect for all of us! My son set up his ""virtual world"" in the TV room and loved having the separate space. My girls loved the playroom! And my husband and I loved that the playroom was only separated by a door from the master bedroom, so the girls had easy access to us. The backyard is great for family dinners, and the house is stocked with everything you need. My 3-year old misses ""our new house."" We cannot wait to go back!"
26503556,526409806,2019-09-08,145085465,Nick,"Kathryns place is the best . First shared Airbnb so a little unsure at first but I was delightfully surprised by the Texan love . highly recommend, we were able to come back whenever and it was no issue . Other unit is on a different level but is a little close so don’t expect privacy out of room as the commonplace is connected by that spiral staircase . Bathroom is private though so rest assured. Piece and rig included so don’t waste your cash"

22209112,256469954,2018-04-22,177745208,Justin,James was a great host and offered a plethora of local advice in regards for things to do.

16589595,131567503,2017-02-12,1710243,Duncan,"Can't recommend this place highly enough. Super responsive, lovely room, plenty of nice touches and convenient to downtown and the airport (with a car).

After a number of average AirBnB stays on this trip, it was great to see Tiela has nailed what AirBnB should be. It was just a shame we only could stay one night."
11240044,166506946,2017-07-03,133071255,Harris,Had a great stay at Greg's! He was such a great host
19503543,287143802,2018-07-07,28833413,Jill,"Kinga was great with check-in and even had bubbles for us in the fridge.

Unfortunately both of the showers were extremely difficult to use. We had 8 girls getting ready there for a wedding; I thought it would be fun having us get ready together but due to the showers it was actually really stressful."
17606274,313591991,2018-08-25,59054721,Michaela,"Carol was a great host- very responsive and has an inviting place. She fills the place with little touches and amenities that made us feel at home, such as chocolate, having extra socks, and having ponchos. She even brought us fresh peaches one morning. The place is small but you’re not traveling to Denver to hang out in an Airbnb. Would recommend! "

15282172,445104935,2019-04-28,50419143,Jasmine,"The place was just as pictured. An open airy floor plan guesthouse with entrance from the sidewalk off the main house. We arrived late so it was dark and initially hard to see but once we opened the gate, the pathway was lit with automatic lights. Check in was easy! We found street parking easily each day at all hours. The space was comfortable and had all the needs for even a longer stay. Close to downtown Denver activities and day trips. Great weekend stay!"
13657498,135686543,2017-03-05,8804775,Pat,Room was very spacious and very thoughtfully appointed. Everything we needed was available. It was a great option for Denver lodging.  Hosts were fantastic.

21013551,419385092,2019-03-03,65161320,Hannah,"My boyfriend and I were stranded in Denver due to snow. Gregg's place was a lovely oasis while we waited out the storm! The room was clean, and decorated well. There was an extra space heater, which we used but didn't really need because the blankets were so warm. Mini fridge and microwave in room, with paper plates/plastic utensils. We came in late, and his cats greeted us at the door and were very friendly. The location is great."
28964822,414473713,2019-02-19,52096162,Mark,"Jenn is one of the best hosts.  If you want a really nice room in a very nice house, then book with Jenn.  Her thoughtfulness goes way further than what you would expect with most hosts.  Jenn has you covered; nice/clean house, food/snacks, water/juice, and many more things.  I would definitely stay here again."

3979810,101776579,2016-09-15,12388849,Valerie,"Anthony's house was in a great location for our stay in Denver. It was easy to get to our daughter's house near DU and also to run errands to stores, etc. Lots of restaurants nearby as well. The house is adequately furnished with a comfortable living room & a split floor plan. Anthony was a great communicator and answered my inquires immediately. He was also very accommodating to let us check in early after our flight from Florida."

It was close to restaurant row and the convention center which was super convenient for us. We surely appreciated Dave and Cal’s suggestions of places to go.  would absolutely return again and stay here again  Worth every penny!

4288813,64453299,2016-03-04,21700457,Tyler,"Hillary has put some nice touches on her rental condo. It is well decorated and features a modern kitchen. The bed is comfortable. The patio has cool lights hanging overhead. The bathroom and kitchen have everything you need. It is close to lot of bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Hilary was responsive and flexible through out the process. 

But  Hilary - I must ask - are you neglecting the maintenance on your unit? You have a long list of maintenance issues. I know this is just a rental, and for the price (which I think is appropriate) I wasn't expecting a five star hotel, but the following issues were every noticeable. Why haven't you taken care of them? 

Bathroom:

- Toilet has a loud leak/drip
- Toilet handle broken
- Towel hanger falling off the wall (and duck taped)
- Exhaust fan rattles
- Switch plate is cracked
- Sink is coming off wall
- Drain on sink is broken - doesnt go up and down

Bedroom:

- Window does not stay open.
- The cord to open/close the blinds is gone

Front room:

- Fireplace doesn’t work
- Bottom lock does not work - duck taped
- Vent is no longer attached to the floor
- Control cradle falls off the wall

Kitchen

- Some of the food you have is long passed expired. I found a decaying lemon in the fridge and eggs that expired months ago. Why do you have expired food laying around?
- 3rd drape missing from sliding door 
- Outlet next to the sink doesnt work
- Garbage disposal sounds like a chainsaw - you need to get it checked
- Refrigerator is tilted so the door hangs open
- One outlet is duct taped to the wall
- Table is wobbly and stabilized by a folded paper towel

Back porch

- Needs to be swept
- Table is filthy

Hallway

- Light switch is falling off the wall
- Blinds don’t close on their own

18582812,241122151,2018-03-07,21847779,Dan,This place was clean and close to many breweries/restaurants.  If you're planning on hanging out in the city this is a good place to stay.
13656290,211630940,2017-11-13,148187733,Chris,Great place for a family trip.
22657843,241850204,2018-03-10,126925865,Zach,Jennifer's carriage house is a perfect spot for a traveling couple. All the necessary amenities and she very thoughtfully left a bottle of wine. We would 100% stay again or recommend

28585411,548462353,2019-10-17,71157653,Christopher,"Great place to crash while visiting Denver.  Quiet neighborhood and room and entry are private. Location is prime, took a bird scooter from our place to Pespi Center 2 nights in a row. TV in room with Netflix and YouTube or using your laptop was also nice. Just make sure you park on the side close to the house, got a $50 ticket parking across the street during sweeping hours."

31503,352543,2011-07-04,743759,Pau,"Rick and Sheldon have a really great place. They maintained it really well and I would say the Highland Park Guesthouse is better than many hotels out there. They use only the best materials -Grohe and Brizo for faucets, Breville for coffeemaker, Kitchenaid for microwave, Bodum for tea warming, etc. Other than that, the place is very spacious and electric outlets are situated in the most convenient places. 

Also, they do our beds everyday, clean the restroom, throw the trash, etc. We were really amazed with how they folded the bedsheets! 

Oh I almost forgot, Rick and Sheldon provided us with laundry soap for the new LG super washer and dryer. 

Parking is free!! Thank goodness! Parking in Denver can get too costly.

Given all that, the place is located very near downtown Denver. It's also 
just half an hour to Boulder so they really have great location too.

If we were to visit Colorado again, we'll definitely check in here!"
29355346,498479292,2019-07-29,5850595,Jen,We had such a wonderful stay at James’s house! It was so lovely and homey and comfy. Would definitely recommend!
8739814,547661298,2019-10-15,90921338,Amanda,Amazing place to stay! Came from California to experience Denver for the first time and to see a Broncos game. So many things are walking distance and the views are beautiful. Erik’s place exceeded our expectations with its available amenities and spaciousness. This space did not disappoint. Definitely made our stay feel like a home away from home.
22106139,288417558,2018-07-09,175864175,Eric,"If you get the privilege to visit Denver for a few days and need a ""home away from home"" place to stay, look no further than the Art House. Space is cozy and well maintained with a private, locked entrance. Ideal location after only a short drive out of the city. Elizabeth was warm, welcoming and available when needed but also respects your privacy. 10/10!"
24746875,479996276,2019-07-01,137274115,Haley,Zach’s place is a great basement apartment in RiNo! It’s all updated and very clean. It was a quick uber drive to all the restaurants and bars we wanted to go to and was great for two couples. We loved it! Thank you!

13474217,130582940,2017-02-06,39271118,Randy,Kinga's place is a must book if it's in the area you are looking for. The restaurants and bars are all very close and made our trip very memorable 
25909447,298777192,2018-07-29,86159656,Cassie,"This was the best air bnb experience I’ve had yet! The place was spotless, stylish, and had more space than I expected. Jalena also left a large assortment of treats on the table and in the fridge. Great hostess! "

833937,188492112,2017-08-29,60069003,Kevin,"We have only good things to say about our stay.  The house was perfect for our group of 3, and the location was ideal as it was very easy for us to get to and from all that Denver has to offer.  It was a quick walk/bike ride/Uber to the different downtown areas, and there was ample street parking for our large rental car that we had throughout our trip.  Eliza was quick to answer any questions we had and made everything very easy for us.  Hoping we can make another trip back!"
25518900,497676053,2019-07-28,76456375,Aly,"10/10 Airbnb! Great hosts, amazing location, adorable home (super super clean)... just the best! Highly recommend. I’ll for sure try to stay here again."
3410364,48694355,2015-09-28,17268782,Kelsey,We didn't see Alison during our stay but we had a fantastic time. There was ample parking by her house and the space was super easy to access. The location is great because it is close to downtown and the major highways. We would stay with her again.
17240910,240437644,2018-03-04,9520538,Carolyn,"Loved my stay here. Super clean and quiet. Perfectly designed space. Excellent linens, comfortable bed, new appliances. Hosts were very responsive. I would definitely stay here again when in Denver. 

Note that it is a smaller space but has a nice table for two and a comfortable reading chair. It's a perfect place to use as your home base and is in a good location."
19180922,203244685,2017-10-14,149478599,Kristen,Perfect location next to SO MANY restaurants! Caroline was great to work with and very quick at responding! Little kitchen and place for parking!
16066443,329361791,2018-09-28,216939706,Julie,"This spot was wonderful!!! Location was perfect being so close to all the sports stadiums, Denver downtown, a lot of convenience stores, and pretty close to some gnarly parks. The space is very nice and we had zero problems with the owners, neighbors, it really was truly a great spot! It is quaint and updated and it’s all we needed as travelers! Hope you decide to stay here, you won’t regret it!"
3992779,71969238,2016-04-30,16139536,Mary,Elizabeth's studio apartment was perfect for my short stay in Denver.  Fully equipped with everything I needed.  Elizabeth even left coffee and a few beers in the fridge for me.  Great location right in the heart of Cap Hill.  Would definitely stay here again.

20761981,208054036,2017-10-30,1663308,Birgitta,"The wifi, frig, microwave, and bed were great. The distance to down town was perfect and made for easy Uber rides on a daily basis. If you have problems with steps, this may not be the spot for you but if you're pretty spry they are manageable. Reza is a cool dude and makes sure you have what you need. He even provided a space heater when the crazy Denver weather snapped from 82 degree to 40s in a day. The keyless entry was very helpful because I was out very early and in late due to my conference schedule. When the downstairs bathroom is back up and running, this spot will be unstoppable."
4817072,37730394,2015-07-10,28161177,Chuck,"The house was great. Just as advertised. Denver was warm in July, but not to worry there was an air conditioner and it worked well.  The house was the perfect size for two and more could fit if you really wanted.

The neighborhood is great. We always felt safe and comfortable walking around. We'd consider that area to live if we were moving there. Plenty of places to eat, and a great walk into Denver.

Parking our rental car was usually easy, but you may have to walk a block at the wrong time of day or night.

The washer/dryer was a bonus. The backyard was a pleasant place to hang out. 

We'd go back"
2239191,34177997,2015-06-05,1632368,Michael,The house was a perfect fit for our three person team traveling to Denver on business. The location was off the beaten path but extremely close to great restaurants and business in Downtown.
21080559,362986563,2018-12-27,120650742,Anthony,Great place to stop by!
38751085,563401761,2019-11-12,81023973,Justin,"Great place for the money. Good space and very thoughtful amenities. Host communicate very quickly. We had a single issue during our stay and it was addressed promptly. Note, there is no dedicated parking. We didn’t have an issue finding a spot on the nearby street, but if the weather is bad - you may be carrying your luggage a block or so."
2908978,434240818,2019-04-07,123921784,Rich,Peaceful was my experience of being enveloped in a cloud-like bed for a quick nap after travel and two luxurious nights. I walked to my nearby event and enjoyed lots of interesting architecture throughout the neighborhood. This home is one of the gems.

Check in couldn't have been easier.  It was perfect for what I was needing."
27338619,468999277,2019-06-13,113875443,Abbey,Brandy’s place was a perfect spot for our trip to Denver. Would absolutely stay there again!
8071897,69216062,2016-04-10,55415093,David,"My boyfriend and I had a very good experience and would recommend it to others for sure. The apartment is clean and cozy, and Erica and Brianna were very attentive and helpful.
I was attending a conference downtown and walked there each morning - very pleasant walk through Denver."

Walking distance to several bars and eateries, and of course Wash Park. Would stay here again in a second!"
17331962,474016889,2019-06-22,169528767,Gabriel,"Clean. Incredible amenities. Lovely hosts. Only issue was the thin walls causing for little sound barrier, but that is easily overlooked by the beautiful space"
8372001,296872102,2018-07-26,9560106,J. W.,"Excellent location in a neighborhood I've come to appreciate close to good food, public transit and downtown. Emma is a gracious host and provided fine accommodations. "

Nice and quite and the SHEETS ARE AMAZING!!! So soft and comfy. We loved our stay and would highly recommend her spot for anyone coming to Denver. "
26131284,519034966,2019-08-27,250393500,Marisa,Stayed here during my honeymoon trip. My husband and I had such a great time here to explore the area and our room was spotless!
23880394,258778351,2018-04-29,62570718,Oben,"David's place was clean. Well organized. He responded timely if we needed. Close enough to nightlife,restaurant and bars. The beds were comfortable"
4191778,297383286,2018-07-27,165259349,Brianna,"Great place to stay! Mike was there to great us and let us know about the area. They were always available if needed but let us do our thing and didn’t make it uncomfortable at all! The furniture is a little dated and extra bedroom bed is a little squeaky but overall the place was cute, clean and we loved the easy walk up to Broadway.  The area is super young but very quiet! Great hosts!!! We left one of our bags and they went above and beyond to get it back to us! "
11338921,194710924,2017-09-17,11301240,Rob,"This place is a steal! Four floors of beautiful living space. The ground floor (actually located on the 2nd floor) is a huge living room and the top level is a spacious, full of natural light loft with an extremely comfortable bed. The place is decorated as if an interior designer got ahold of it! 

The loft is within walking distance to Coors Field, if you're heading to a Rockies game. Parking our rental was no problem and the car was locked in a gated parking lot, so that was a plus. 

As other reviews mention, there are a lot of homeless people in this area. We walked around a lot and had no issues. It seems there are a couple shelters nearby, hence the popularity of the area. If you're a light sleeper, I'd also recommend ear plugs or a noise maker as the street below is busy with traffic, people, and emergency vehicles. 

We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
17154609,514687967,2019-08-21,209322004,Corey,"Amazing place in an amazing location! Ahmed’s home was sparkling clean. The rooftop deck was wonderful. I never saw Ahmed, but he responded immediately to text messages and provided very clear directions. I definitely recommend staying here."

12649682,276433544,2018-06-13,17500053,Leah,"Maren is a great host -- flexible, communicative, and helpful. Her home is beautiful, clean, and in the perfect neighborhood for exploring the best parts of Denver. The room is perfect for a couple. We were grateful for her hospitality!"
24497089,271254515,2018-05-31,95112004,Jillienne,"This home is even better than the pictures reflect! The pictures from the rooftop haven't been taken with zoom - the stadium really is that close. The finishes are high end, the home is well decorated in a functional and welcoming way, and all furniture is very comfortable - especially the beds. The dining room has been updated since the pictures were taken and now holds an amazing, family-style table that seats six. This room also offers plenty of games for hanging out at night when you're winding down from a day of enjoying the beautiful outdoors. The location is great, whether you are looking for a quick trip into downtown Denver or easy highway access. Boulder and Red Rocks were each about a 25 minute drive from this location - of course, dependent upon traffic. There are hidden gems all around the home, in every direction. Sloan's Lake is very close and offers picture perfect views of the downtown skyline as you walk around the lake. There are several authentic Mexican restaurants on Federal and we enjoyed both the food and the service. We visited two great breweries within walking distance - Briar Common and Little Machine. Like much of Denver, this area is in development and currently houses a mix of older, single homes and newer, townhouses and apartment buildings. There is a lot of work going on in the surrounding area, but we didn't hear anything from our townhouse. Most importantly, Heather is an excellent host. She was very responsive and available if we needed anything at all. Heather also sent a few messages, both ahead of our trip and during, with thoughtful tips for our stay. "
4236002,328954916,2018-09-27,21107539,Jenna,Great stylish place not too far from the heart of Denver! Would 100% recommend!
13972526,339474778,2018-10-21,133588977,Juma,The house is awesome! The location is perfect and puts you pretty close to a few nice spots in the city. It was just me by myself and the house was enough space without feeling overwhelming or cramped. I would definitely book it again.
21307722,214352089,2017-11-25,156698475,Geary,"This was our first experience with AirBnb and I found it quite enjoyable. It was much more comfortable and homey than a hotel stay.  Splitting the cost between the group of us also made it affordable.

We were all surprised by the amenities we found throughout the house. This made you feel right at home. I especially enjoyed the fact that I could get up in the morning and have my coffee and/or breakfast while my wife was getting ready.

Yes, I would use AirBnb again."
23626064,509497689,2019-08-14,168651454,Michael,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29212648,425064321,2019-03-17,34227633,Danny,"I would absolutely stay here again! Instead of exploring Denver like proper tourists, we loved this place so much that we decided to spend more time indoors. We watched season three of Queer Eye, and the place, true to the pictures, looked exactly like something Bobby would've designed."
14842171,505699237,2019-08-09,114858294,Natalie,We really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back to Michele’s Airbnb. The great hospitality and sweet attention to detail made a stay that felt like home.

833937,71043605,2016-04-23,49104773,Marissa,"Eliza's home is so beautiful! In a great central neighborhood with friendly neighbors. The home gets a lot of sun and is so comforting. It really feels like a loved home with lots of character. The gifts she left are a fantastic touch, a bottle of wine, chocolate, and a fruit bowl full of perfect little clementines (my favorite). She left a lot of specific directions which made things very easy for my group after a long night of traveling. The guidebook has some fantastic recommendations as well. "
10266757,254664328,2018-04-17,42430573,Gilbert,We had a wonderful time at Jim's place! The space was exactly as described. It was the perfect place to relax after a busy day of shopping downtown as well as hiking through the national park. Street parking was free and easy to find. The location is walking distance to some great coffee shops and only a quick trip to the heart of downtown. We would definitely recommend staying here!
19116038,227706380,2018-01-15,10235768,Sven,"Courtney's place was an ideal jumping off point for getting to know Denver a foot. There was plenty of transportation to and from airport and many awesome places in the neighborhood. For places in Airbnb's I find that the little things make or break the experience. Courtney wrote us some great local places, had a white-noise maker, and a coffee grinder/maker. These touches made our stay like at home."

She made me feel like home with her caring and loving self. I had a cold during my stay and she brought me an extra box of tissues which was amazing! The space itself is huge and private. It felt very safe in her home and I loved the washer/dryer! Thank you for housing Leon and myself :)

Our host left a very nice note letting us know of info we might need, and there were little complementary toiletries. I would highly recommend this stay."
2817786,15105251,2014-07-02,16251004,Etienne,"Mary is an amazing host. We stayed 5 nights, and she made us feel welcome and at home from the first contact. The room is quiet and well decorated, as the rest of the house, and the bed is very comfortable. The house is very conveniently located, in a beautiful street, close to downtown and within walking distance of all the great restaurants on the 17th avenue. If you'd rather cook yourself, it's even only a couple minutes walk away from the Safeway.
As we had never been to Denver before, Mary gave us nice suggestions on what to do in the area, and we had a great time. We hope to visit again!"
4263661,183994065,2017-08-18,997274,Ash,"Firstly, Melissa and John are lovely and a pleasure to be around. There house is fantastic and in a lovely part of town, and walking distance to downtown. Will be my first call next time I'm in Denver."
98014,89269438,2016-07-27,4615786,Rushikesh,"Jim is a great host, taking care of all the details.  He is extremely welcoming and makes you feel very comfortable in his house, which is a masterpiece, having restored it himself. 

Being extremely close to downtown, it is great place to live, if you need quick access to the business district."
33251110,465939057,2019-06-08,21856324,Pearline,"Our stay was a good experience. Great location to many restaurants and the airport is only 15 minutes away which was a factor in choosing it. You can park curbside right in front of the house, the house is new and the bedroom was private with it’s own bathroom. The adjustable bed was super comfortable and the big screen tv was nice. I would recommend staying there to anyone and if the occasion arose again I would definitely stay there again."
26278457,294144179,2018-07-21,36655600,Darryl,Beautiful dog with a loving personality. The home was as described. Not too far from DT and a nice place to sleep.
12276698,531485178,2019-09-17,243521070,Kimberly,"This home was as advertised and much more. Check in was easy and the location is great. We were able to walk from the front door to the art galleries and antique shops in about 5mins. There were thoughtful touches throughout the home just incase you forgot an essential, not to mention the home itself has so much character! A trip to downtown and the Denver Art Museum was a quick 7min drive and only a few more minutes to Five Points. We had a rental while visiting and was always able to find parking on the street right in front of the house which made parking a breeze. 

Also: When we first arrived a few mins early, we walked in on someone cleaning the house. It’s one thing to read and assume that these homes we rent on this site are tidy, but to see someone diligently cleaning and preparing for our arrival warmed my heart and made our stay that much more comfortable and relaxing!!!"
18211893,161357589,2017-06-17,68554824,Mandy,"Zach's place was beautiful, comfortable and accommodated 6 people. Location was great and we walked to many places.

We didn't spend excessive amounts of time at his home, but it was a great spot to crash at the end of the day. Not super close to downtown, but it was only a Lyft or a short walk away from where we needed/wanted to go."
20309642,464908182,2019-06-06,31030230,Gabela,"Heathers place was the ideal stay. I felt so comfortable there with all the amenities I needed. I really appreciated the detail in her home such as water & shower filters, nontoxic cleaners, diffuser and sauna ! The neighborhood is safe and so fun to walk around local shops & cafes. Definitely worth the great price."
18892011,291326968,2018-07-15,65485174,Brook,"You will not be disappointed with this space.   Impeccably clean and after a long day of travel, the thoughtful touch of having granola bars and snacks on hand was a life-saver.  Quick responses to all of my questions and very pleasant to work with.  We highly recommend Suzana’s guest house."

20617423,224629444,2018-01-03,165322299,Corey,Julie and Angelo were amazingly nice. All of our electronics died while flying and we got  to the house around 11:30 and I forgot to write down the info for the keys and had to knock on her home super late and she came and opened the door for us. Extremely nice human. The place was perfect.

The room is neat and tidy. The beds are comfortable.  Becky also communicate clearly with us.
Parking along the driveway can be crowded in the evening. Be prepared to park a little farther. No problem at all because the neighbourhood seems good."
4344095,47066061,2015-09-15,40960733,Kailee,"I would definitely choose to stay here again. The apartment was really nice and clean! (I'm a bit of a germaphob so this was clean in my book). They laid out towels and notes for us too.  Denver was so awesome we already can't wait to be back! The only downside is that their apartment is 2 blocks away from the food banks. So the surrounding area gets very crowded during any meal hour. Other than that, it was great! :)"
18811589,246084885,2018-03-24,39525532,Asish,Marlene's place was beautiful and located in nice neighborhood.

8686305,366979457,2019-01-03,154233634,Nghia,"The first thing you can expect staying here is the excellent location. There are tons of food options nearby, things to do, and you are not far away from Downtown Denver. Accessibility to locations is simple and easy for multiple things to do in Denver. The home was beautiful. The home was extremely clean and organized. The bedroom was great, there is a small basket of water, snacks, coffee, and then guides in the room to help you plan things to do in Denver. The room also includes extra bed sheets, pillows, blankets, and anything else you may need to accommodate yourself. There is a gym downstairs in the basement that is nice to use. The TV right above the fireplace is a relaxing spot to use to end your day. The terrace is a beautiful spot where you can hangout. The sunset is really pretty to watch as it drifts over the mountains. If and when I come back to Denver, this is the spot that I will be using. Billy and his family are great hosts and are extremely sweet

Plus, the most adorable hypo-allergenic dog might also be there to greet you at the door!

The backyard is quite spacious, and we loved eating breakfast on the front patio.  We did not have any issues with the temperature, there were plenty of fans throughout the house and an A/C unit upstairs.

25477072,333054316,2018-10-06,60255346,Ron,"Over the summer of 2018, my wife and I made plans surrounding a fall reunion in Colorado of my Air Force unit that served the better part of 1971 in Thailand. 

First, it would be three days in Denver, followed by a week around the state and a couple of days in New Mexico, then a few final more days in Denver before flying back home to the East Coast.

We were looking for a home in the Denver city limits not far from our car rental company and transportation to the airport, in a nice neighborhood, a home with wonderful amenities and an owner with great instincts.

My wife and I looked on-line at the various available Airbnb homes and LaMark's hit a grand slam with his wonderful abode.

LaMark quickly responded to our query that he had an available room.

Nice!

Fast forward to near the end of our trip.

We pulled up to LaMark's well-appointed home, knocked on the door and quickly introduced ourselves to the man, himself.

Turns out, LaMark, too, was in the Air Force and that's what quickly caught his eye. OK, so we told war stories. :)

He ushered us in, showed us around, pointed out the rooms, bathroom, kitchen and living room.

Perfect!

LaMark is a great guy, very easy to chat with and someone who offers wonderful suggestions for nearby restaurants. 

Additionally, LaMark takes pride in his home to make sure that everything is in tip-top shape.

 And, it is!"

Because Street parking can be difficult, consider parking and using ride services, particularly if you’ll be returning after 8:30 or 9:00 PM."

Tony had two laminated sheets of recommendations for nearby things to do and places to eat waiting for us as soon as we checked into the room. The room itself was lovely, cozy, and spotlessly clean, and I kept discovering thoughtful little touches throughout our entire stay.

548897,81125780,2016-06-21,2808033,Isabelle,"The area was very nice and the incredible lush rose garden all around the house makes it very poetic and beautiful. Heather solved an air vent problem very kindly and efficiently although we didn't happen to meet. We would recommend breakfast and diner in Vine Street, very close by. We were able to park close by which was great. Thanks Heather !"
13845981,241863822,2018-03-10,120453474,Holly,"Easy check in, can come and go without them having to be there which is great. You get your own room and bathroom which I loved! Very cute, friendly dog that wanted to be my buddy "
22941573,506520167,2019-08-10,205146590,Marissa,"This place was nice and clean!  The younger kids loved the play area in the back yard and my oldest son and daughter loved the hockey table, there was enough room for our family and the place was beautiful"

13271918,475734754,2019-06-24,176608088,Melissa,"This property is in a wonderful location on a quiet tree-lined street, in close proximity to restaurants, stores, and area attractions. The pictures accurately depict a cozy, very clean home with many amenities. It is not the hotel-style of rental, rather a genuine home with personal effects. A full a large, clean kitchen with all the accessories may be appealing to guests who don't want to eat all meals out. There's a lovely roof deck that were it not so chilly during our stay would've been even more appealing. We did not have a vehicle, but the availability of a parking space would be a huge bonus in an area where parking is tricky. The host, Marin, communicated promptly and pleasantly with us, both before and during our stay. This is a lovely property-- we'll definitely be back when we return to Denver soon!"
13078248,456510109,2019-05-21,477125,Jennifer,"Maren’s room was the perfect place to stay for my two-night solo stopover in Denver. She was welcoming and friendly, as was her sweet golden retriever pup. The location was great since the house is a short walk to the Main Street in the Highlands with lots of restaurants, bars, and shops to choose from. The room (and  the rest of the house) is clean and cozy - highly recommend!"
29358113,420097479,2019-03-05,188053425,Carlos,Love this place!! I’ll be very soon

37292895,530339731,2019-09-15,291677463,Jennifer,"This was a cute & clean place to stay for the weekend. There were 3 of us, so it was nice that the futon in the living area could be a third bed. The hosts were quick to respond to any of our questions and we liked the location."
13478248,183249396,2017-08-16,70494038,Jen,"During our stay, we walked almost everywhere. This location is excellent."
4052272,484404017,2019-07-08,119822735,Dylan,"Expect a gracious host. The sofa is really not sleepable so plan on maxing out the bed or bringing an air mattress. It’s a good value but you make up for it in transportation to/around the city if you don’t have a car. Lastly, prepare for a little bit of noise from above as this is a basement apartment."
27432059,568583515,2019-11-24,15983374,Leigh,"These guys are doing AirBnB right! They made check-in easy with crystal clear instructions, the place was super clean and comfortable, the listing represented the property perfectly. Clear communication and fast responses to any of our questions. We had a great stay! Highly recommended!"
21112509,477637110,2019-06-28,26469001,Megan,Great value and short Uber ride to downtown Denver. Easy access in/out of the residence and nice to have a full kitchen.
22986768,424381958,2019-03-16,15055538,Rob,This place was perfect for both comfort and location. Even had a few super friendly pets to keep us company. My only complaint was that I wish We could have stayed longer!
14612748,170096859,2017-07-14,2755761,Jessica,"Shawn (and Angela and May in cafe) are lovely, friendly and helpful. Shawn went out of her way to offer help and is very generous. I was there for a conference for a week and it was such a fun neighborhood to stay in, with great food in cafe below and all around the neighborhood. (great ice cream shop ""sweet cow"" a block away). Transportation is easy and there are nice houses, gardens and parks nearby. The bed is very comfortable and it was a perfect place for me to stay, in walking distance to where I had to be.  Apt. is a bit dark (for me) and in summer the AC in windows block some of light that comes in. It did get hot at times as it was nearly 100 degrees in Denver! There is AC in apt. but some electrical work was needed in order to run both units at same time. Host is working on fixing.  I loved popping downstairs to cafe in morning for coffee and breakfast. It a convenient and comfortable place with friendly hosts in a fun area! Thank you!"
21183938,242901717,2018-03-13,30235114,David,Grant’s place is a great space that was conveniently located. The space matched the description and pictures and worked out perfectly for our stay in Denver.

1911814,14533860,2014-06-21,1718187,Stephen,"Randy is an absolute pro in hosting! He was always so prompt and helpful with any questions I had. The location was perfect and in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking. The suite looks even better in person, extremely clean, and had all the amenities I needed for my 5 night stay in Denver. The shower was beautiful, the bed was perfect, and I slept as if I were in my own home. I will definitely be booking with Randy again on my next trip. If you get a chance, book here, you won't regret it!"
24474523,488912413,2019-07-15,274987954,Curtis,"It's a really nice location with lots of restaurants, etc within easy walking distance. Parking can be a challenge on weekends during the day, but I noticed that many more of them opened up toward the evening. The room and the shower were both very clean and the bed was comfortable. I really didn't get a chance to meet the hosts, but it was perfect for my needs - a place to sleep while exploring and seeing friends in the area."
22638292,304472940,2018-08-09,20576505,Dan,"Jacqueline's place is immaculately clean and conveniently located within walking distance of downtown. Although we only crossed paths with her a few times, she was a hospitable host and gave us great recommendations. We would definitely stay there again!"
7091323,52983565,2015-11-03,45179151,Olavo,A good place to stay couple nights.
5604348,30555515,2015-04-24,28997883,Toni,"Brandon and Robert were the best hosts you could ever imagine, I LOVE their apmt and I'll come back many times!

First of all, their apartment is even better than described, perfectly clean, newly renovated and an absolute gem! It is very centrally located, everything is perfectly organised with information about the apmt, denver area etc. You couldn't imagine a better, more personal and passionate written guide for the area than their booklet. And even if you still have a (stupid) question they will be there for you. As the entire apmt is on the state-of-the-art, they made it possible that you don't even need keys but you have access all the time. And you have of course all the amenities you could dream of: broadband wifi, netflix, parking space infront of the house, huge fridge, great bathroom, walk-in closet etc. etc. etc. I could go on here for hours. In a nutshell: the apmt is perfect!

Secondly, their skills as hosts: we got a very nice welcome, they introduced us to lovely friends of them, met with us in their leisure, organised some program for us, brought us to the airport early in the morning (although they came too late to work as we overslept... so sorry! Again...). And they even gave us the contacts of their friend in another city we visited afterwards. Another small example of their hospitality: they bought a sixpack of a local brewery for us and put it in the fridge that we will be welcomed by a cold beer! Again, I could go on here for hours and days. They are just perfect!

I would recommend this apmt only to very nice people as Brandon and Robert only deserve the best guests! We loved it! Thank you so much!"
35382462,492776758,2019-07-21,267876959,Christina,"Fantastic place to stay in the Denver area, very closely located to fun shops and restaurants and bars. Quiet area, private. Great house, wonderfully stocked with surprising welcoming snacks! Perfect home away from home."
20914531,348132494,2018-11-12,53346674,James,"The value for the location of this place is great especially if you don't mind short walks to the tram, longer walks to RiNo, or $7-8 Lyft rides pretty much anywhere you would want to go.  It is exactly as advertised and some of the things are old to the point where they are falling apart (the screen door handle fell out on us), but don't let that deter you from this great find!  I would recommend this place to people who want to get out and explore Denver, not for people who want a place to hang out for most of the day.  It is best for 2 people, but easily sleeps 4 if necessary.  The heat, hot water, and water pressure were great especially for the cold nights, and a couple of chilly days!  The hosts also have a list of suggestions or you can ask them for some directly."
13041992,526396262,2019-09-08,47184759,Richard,"Exactly the sort of place we needed. Communication was excellent and check in very easy. Spotlessly clean and perhaps bigger than it seemed in the photos. And as a bonus, generous complimentary snacks ands drinks. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
29187078,414475688,2019-02-19,101146486,Elizabeth,"This was a great deal. Not the best location for walking but quick drive to tourist destinations. The only downside to this place would be if you are tall it has low ceilings. We were comfortable, the place was sparkling clean, and quiet. My sister and I would definitely stay again."

Marv(owner) is great. Very helpful if you need anything."

The house is in a great neighborhood, close to downtown and many shops and restaurants.  Easy access to the Dever B bikes and the bus.  I left feeling relaxed and refreshed."

22880838,327399337,2018-09-23,117431972,James,"You won’t be disappointed with this place. A new modern townhome in a very cool neighborhood with a short walk to outstanding coffee shops, bars, and breweries. Short Uber to anywhere downtown. Love the rooftop deck!"

It was also a convenient location to other activities we had planned. The studio was clean, had everything we needed and Jenna adds in some thoughtful touches. Jenna also responded to messages quickly and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again in the future!"

35382462,496663754,2019-07-27,274603760,Sandra,"Booking this AirBNB was the best decision we made on our trip to Denver. The house is so welcoming and charming. We were two couples and we stayed at the house for most of our trip. The backyard is amazing with a cute zen tree and grill. The shower head had so much pressure it felt like a massage. The host stayed in contact with me and sent me so many suggestions of what to do and eat. Best of all, we did not need to rent a car as there are an abundance of restaurants vintage shops and dispensaries walking distance. The space is very 420 friendly, no smoking allowed inside however the backyard gives you a private area with beautiful scenery to enjoy your toke :). Will be staying here every time we visit Denver."
29013476,548408147,2019-10-17,32826707,Katie,"Really clean, quiet room in a guest house above the garage. Nicely decorated with all of the amenities you'd get at a hotel and more. Street parking was very easy and it's close to downtown denver (10 minute drive). Candice greeted me when I arrived and was friendly throughout. You'll need to walk down the side of the house and up a flight of stairs to reach the room (or go through the back gate)."
32138363,430469770,2019-03-30,25463838,Aaron,Great location and sparkling clean. Just a 5 minute rip to most of Lodo or Rino. Super quiet at night great place to crash.

22201970,227878823,2018-01-16,24755477,Hansen,Great apartment and location! Also came with a free pass to the Botanical Gardens that I used and really enjoyed! Only thing to note is parking is difficult on the street but other than that it was walking distance to downtown Denver.

The B-Cycle station is very conveniently located outside of the building and we used that for most of our transportation. Aldona was great to communicate and always responded quickly."
17498473,334972852,2018-10-10,40299701,Gina,"Perfect size for 2 people. Because of the unusually gloomy, cold weather we got while we were in Denver, we appreciated the small cozy space and access to chrome cast. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with supplies, the towels were super soft, and the cute decor made us feel at home. We had a car, so we didn’t use public transport, but we did notice is was close by. We think this is a great value for singles or a couple passing a few days in the mile high city."

12996773,99681761,2016-09-05,10206482,Chelsea,"My time at Tina's was far too short, but without a doubt one of the most heartwarming airbnb experiences I've had.  I booked my stay just a few hours before my arrival and Tina was more than accommodating.  Not only did she help me out in a pinch, but she was kind to let my friend who I was driving with get ready in the space.  Extremely close to downtown and the Highlands there are plenty of awesome bars, restaurants, and places to explore nearby.  Even with the plethora of fun spots that were close, I had a great time talking and getting to know Tina.  She is an interesting woman full of life experience and stories I just couldn't get enough of.  Her home was absolutely beautiful and every piece seemed to have a unique background.  I truly enjoyed my stay with Tina.  I look forward to returning to Denver and staying with her in the future, fingers crossed.  If you're looking for a warm welcoming, clean, cozy/unique, and conveniently located home I absolutely recommend staying with Tina!  Thanks again! "

2467260,75445431,2016-05-21,28988501,Judy,"Ryan was wonderful in communicating with us prior to arrival and making sure that everything we needed was taken care of.  He even offered to answer any questions about the Denver area and provided recommendations of things to do and places to eat.  The apartment was incredibly comfortable and having the full kitchen and dining area allowed us to eat in most of the time, thus saving us money.  The beds were comfy, the apartment was clean and tidy, and access to downtown and places beyond was easy.  It was perfect for what we needed and we would absolutely love to stay here again in the future.  Thank you, Ryan, for making our stay easy and enjoyable!"
16548314,280179083,2018-06-22,174847400,Vanessa,We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage. I could not say enough about the awesome location this Airbnb is at! So close to so many awesome things to do in Denver! Tomas is so easy to get in touch with and responds promptly. The kitchen has all the essentials you need. There is a big main window ac in the living room which cools the place nicely and a nice sized window fan in the bedroom. Lucky for us the weather was nice while we were in Denver. My family and I appreciated Tomas’ hospitality!
15238465,547714122,2019-10-15,280751689,Tanya,Beautiful place! And quick responses.

12963374,197158353,2017-09-24,2721342,David,"The house has a nice Old Denver feel to it, the room was nice and being within walking distance to Denver's downtown nightlife, the metro and other public transportation was a great plus. I would definitely stay there again."
11336016,495273437,2019-07-25,227029556,Kimberly,Great location. Wonderful view from the rooftop area. Close to downtown area. Very comfy bed. Well worth it.
16589595,199329309,2017-10-01,29691703,Rio,Amazing! We just arrived in town and they let us check in 30 minutes late at 11:30pm when our original time was for 9-11. It was a key entry from the back and easy access. Also let us stay 30 minutes after check out time. Recommend !!
23858844,331441652,2018-10-02,215523025,Lora,"Perfect space! Loved the location.. just a walk from some amazing dining and drinks. You can see the baseball field from the cute little porch where we drank our morning coffee. Very clean, comfy, space! Nadim was amazing!! Very quick to respond, helpful, generous, and loved his list of favorites around the neighborhood! We took advantage of the list and we enjoyed every one we went to! Loved it! We’ll be back!!"
875596,15746894,2014-07-15,12826863,Michelle,Staying at Matt's house made our trip to Denver a memorable one.  He was very warm and welcoming!!  Offered us herbs and veggies from his garden if we were going to be cooking.  The house was perfect for our stay.  I slept great and was sad to leave! Thank you so much for being a wonderful host! Cheers! 
852934,76463221,2016-05-27,10338929,Yan,"My family and I loved the time that we spent in Tom's house. The house is very spacious and we loved the Asian decorations. The neighborhood is quiet, so we had a very good rest. Tom is a very considerate host. He prepared fruits and tomatoes from his garden for us, and on the last day, he helped us carry luggage (we had many of them) into the car in the very early morning, because we had an early flight. These are just some small details, but they made us feel like home, and we had a very good time in Denver. I highly recommend this place for others to stay. "
23748316,410101510,2019-02-09,101763667,Laura,A great place to stay! I would go back.
24751956,504994684,2019-08-08,67196333,Elizabeth,Pretty place. Some issues with communication.
37915799,548081723,2019-10-16,301740777,Anna,"Fantastic stay! Sparkling clean, close to everything. Amy was a great host!"
21321438,406477555,2019-01-29,26130010,Kim,"The 3 story row house was clean, uncluttered and comfortable.  The place is fairly new and well maintained. It is located within a couple blocks of a big supermarket and 3 or 4 restaurants. The nearby very large city park provides a great place for a walk."
17387231,476638423,2019-06-26,259665215,Danielle,Taylor’s place is in a great location for exploring downtown Denver. We enjoyed his place and his dog was adorable! Definitely recommend staying here.
19751421,518424346,2019-08-26,29453854,Marijke,A special place to be! You can sit in the garden and enjoy the meals you can make in the perfect kitchen
18616037,464865960,2019-06-06,138046181,Emily,This house has everything you possibly need
22922557,366975371,2019-01-03,4047746,Swapna,"Street parking was easy and plentiful, plus there's a dedicated parking spot in the back. The place is pretty small so I wouldn't recommend it for more than 2 people. Ubers to downtown Denver (around Union Station and 16th St) were in the $10-15 range. There are quite a few good restaurants that are within a 15-20 minute walk as well."
20917414,214368560,2017-11-25,37074376,Terri,"The rental was a cheaply appointed DIY flip. Poorly executed. Poorly managed. There was very little thought to the needs of a short term renter. For example, there were no paper towels, no cutting boards, no clean sponges (there was one used sponge) and no tea kettle. The wifi was spotty at best. When we asked about kitchen supplies we were provided with a 1/2 used roll of paper towel left on the front porch. I will say there were plenty of bath towels which was nice. The bath tub was unusable, wasn't clean, did not drain well and did not hold water. The faucet handles were not securely fastened and one of the 2 towel hooks was broken off. The bedroom lamp that was placed on the one nightstand was not plugged in because there is no outlet near it. 
On the bright side, the location was great, very central and within walking distance to two of Denver's great parks as well as restaurants and coffee shops. Unfortunately, there was garbage overflowing from the trash cans out front and strewn about the walkway. Finding parking nearby was challenging after 5pm. 
We would not recommend this house at the price we paid."
11336016,320362439,2018-09-08,168561651,Daniela,Sally was great- she was very helpful and accommodating! Was a bit hot without AC for September but the fan helped. Overall had a great time.
18002228,243131398,2018-03-14,89593718,Susie,. It was so beautiful and lovely. It is decorated so nice and creative. So clean and very spacious. Had netflix on both tvs so that was nice. A guidebook on where everything is and tips on restaurants to go to. Very nice!! Great area right by mall
22387134,238756358,2018-02-26,142681057,Molly,"What a great place! Derek was welcoming and responsive, and the location is great!"
22515364,259271464,2018-04-30,95713166,Teresa,"My brother and I were in Denver celebrating him getting his masters and we couldn’t have had a better experience. Stephen’s loft is beautiful, in a great location and his hospitality cannot be beat. When we come back to Denver, we will definitely be staying here."
20170743,486505285,2019-07-12,129343741,Kelsi,"Our stay at Brady’s place was fantastic! We were in town for an event at the Pepsi Center and it was perfect for our needs. Brady left snacks on the kitchen counter, a nice and thoughtful touch! It was very clean and welcoming. Brady’s communication was top notch and check in/check out was efficient. We will definitely hope Brady’s place is available for all our future Denver needs. Great location and quiet neighborhood for being a 5 minute drive away from down town Denver."
15802763,237365170,2018-02-22,19867924,Stephanie,"Marcus was extremely accommodating from letting us check in very early, to greeting us when we arrived... he even told us to help ourselves to drinks/snacks left in the pantry! You can tell he has a passion for this and it shows in his hospitality and the way he cares for the apartment. The decor was unbelievable- I loved it so much that I took pictures of it! He even had turf on the balcony! The beds were all so comfy. It is a great place to chill out and enjoy Colorados recreational activities, and in a perfect location for restaurants and stores. I hope to come back when it is warmer and take more advantage of this walkable city."
17556772,458923492,2019-05-26,87622369,Nick,Cool location and neighborhood. Harold was a great host. The apartment was perfect for our group and parking was easy even on a public street.
16406440,533482520,2019-09-21,253463621,Nicholas,Awesome stay!! Loved staying here!
33716343,472451128,2019-06-19,148296047,DeJuan,Place is pretty much as described it’s a basement so it’s pretty small height wise.  A few lights didn’t work but other than that place is as described and the neighborhood is nice and quiet
14728998,278246265,2018-06-17,168816247,Sambo,"Steven’s home provided us with a memorable first stay in Denver. The space was as described with inviting amenities. If we ever needed anything, Steven was always more than willing to serve as a concierge. I would definitely stay here again if I am ever back in Denver."
4574082,256466238,2018-04-22,175753514,Naomy,We had a blast this weekend and we’re so thankful for a nice clean home to stay at where we could cook and relax in our own space would definitely recommend Sheila’s place to anyone out there!
21007311,410154007,2019-02-09,215111158,Jordan,Great stay!
26326152,365750321,2019-01-01,51913664,Jason,This is an amazing place in one of the best spots in Denver. The location is literally close to anything you would want to check out in the Rhino Art District. Had a great New Year’s Eve in Denver thanks to this spot!
5649152,153790286,2017-05-21,122108840,Brian,"Very clean, very easy to work with owner."

29648536,486489356,2019-07-12,208096665,Ryley,"A very nice stay, very clean and well thought out. Only thing I noticed what the air conditioning at night. We set it to 65 and it stayed around 76 all night. But I would definitely stay here again:)"
23238971,253513938,2018-04-14,102312317,Monica,I loved staying here on my trip to Denver. Sean was such a great host and his house was perfect for our stay. It's close to all the Denver hot spots and it's just a few block away from some really cool local bars and coffee shops.
5966633,367346632,2019-01-04,127463307,Elizabeth,"This was a super cute space and exactly what we were looking for! It was the perfect cozy space for just two people. This adorable place was easy walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants on S Broadway. 
The shower was huge, as was the kitchen space. We really appreciated the washer and dryer so we could travel back home after a week with clean clothes. We would definitely be back if we’re ever in Denver again!"
10284327,204156333,2017-10-16,92356971,Linda,"This was our first AirBnB rental and we couldn't have been happier with our experience.  Ken and Olivia are great hosts - always responded to inquiries very quickly and were very helpful. The house was lovely and we had everything we needed. We loved being able to park our car in the garage, and there was plenty of other parking for family to visit (a bunch of family were in town for our son's wedding). The location is great - groceries at Sprouts just around the corner, restaurants and nightlife on Colfax Ave, and the park just up the street.  We had a wonderful time!"
8474753,67767529,2016-03-31,41745045,Cody,"A wonderful find! The space is spacious and accommodating (coffee, silverware, Roku, free Lyft pass, workout pass). Great location that was in walking distance of stores, restaurants, & bars. Also easy to access downtown with a bus stop right outside. Sloan lake is also close by and is a great place to walk around!"
1223612,39937876,2015-07-27,34484648,Chip,"This is an eclectic little place to stay in a wonderful neighborhood.  Not fancy, a little funky, but worth the price.  Bed is not too bad, but know that it is not a Queen - barely a ""full"" size.  The room we stayed in also had a sleeper sofa thingy that Cynthia put a mattress ""topper"" on for us, so it was useable.  If you go in the summer or fall, make sure to ask for a fan in your room, as there is no A/C.  The neighborhood of old houses is pretty cool, and Cheesman Park nearby is wonderful! Cynthia is a delightful host."
18137155,225215375,2018-01-05,8686393,Jeremy,Great host! Eloise does her best to make you feel welcome and comfortable the moment you arrive. She's a very nice and thoughtful person. I definitely recommend her haven.
8410937,111294674,2016-10-30,36806168,Chelsea,Dave's house was awesome! Very clean and in a great location. He was great with communication and I would definitely stay here again!
6623325,453784963,2019-05-16,22096676,Meghan,"Had a wonderful stay at Kelly’s! Her home is very comfortable, and Kelly herself is warm and inviting host! She gave us some pro tips and eating and parking in the city, and even made us muffins for us!! 
Definitely planning to stay again!"

6300806,245098683,2018-03-20,9763076,Kelly,"John's place is super stylish and he is super kind.  Both of these made the stay outstanding.  I was in the mood for a place to chill alone and relax - and his large upstairs bedroom was an incredible reprieve.  Although I didn't interact too much with John, he was also super nice and kind - the perfect host, indeed."
19116038,194906462,2017-09-17,36984423,Maciej,"Thanks Courtney! It was quick, simple, nice and easy stay. All the best!"
5402378,223697099,2018-01-01,32546595,Stephanie,This little chateau feels like a home away from home. Very cozy and comfortable. Beds were comfortable! The hot tub was a great way to relax after a long day. Andrei and Cecilia were very responsive and kind. Great experience and would certainly recommend them.
678602,156159274,2017-05-29,75851204,Lauren,"loved this place! cute location, best breakfast burritos across the street too! very comfortable, clean,  and perfect kitchen.  the back yard was wonderful for cooking out, and relaxing.  the park was perfect for my pooch:-) "

16203754,529387385,2019-09-14,134844354,James,Jessica was incredibly helpful in her knowledge of the city. Her kindness shone through every time we encountered each other. She’s an accommodating hostess with a great attitude. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Denver. Cheers Jessica!
20920175,208519546,2017-11-01,11573728,Kevin,"Julie and Angelo's home was perfect for our half week long getaway! It was an usually large guest house situated atop their main home. Very private. Extremely clean and practically stocked. Julie and Angelo provided 5 star, white glove service - they have a great notebook they created with all their favorite area recommendations. They even left us bath soaps, lotions, coffee, a mini fridge stocked with sodas and beer and Halloween treats for our final night - what a surprise! If you're looking for something that's 5 minutes walking from shops, restaurants or bars, this place may not be a fit for you, but it's on a quiet street with everything within about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute uber ride. We will be back! "
7359477,115090981,2016-11-21,38027798,Olyvia,"Tess's house was perfect for my stay in Colorado. If you're looking for privacy in a tranquil setting this home is the way to go. The house was very clean and in order. It was central to all locations.

The water pressure in the shower and the finishing touches throughout the house were probably my favorite components of the house.

The only downfall for me was that check out was at 11am. So if you're not a morning person keep that in mind. However, I would definitely consider staying here again."
16925673,425652219,2019-03-18,29713138,Mary,It was lovely to share a home for a few days on our visit to Denver. So much more space to enjoy than a hotel room and less expensive. The availability of the kitchen stocked with coffee and snacks made the mornings more like being at home. Close to the town center too. We enjoyed our stay and will stay there on our next trip.
31222017,436293782,2019-04-12,38587361,Brian,"Amazing place!  Bryan and Lottie went above and beyond to make sure everything was taken of, even when an issue came up from bad weather.  Amazing communication on their end!  Definitely recommend this!"
142683,497792,2011-09-03,909120,Chris,"My family and I stayed with Nancy on our recent stay in Denver for the American Chemical Society meeting. We were only a short cab trip from the convention center, and it was ideal staying only a block down from the city park. The house was clean and comfortable, even for our large family, and Nancy kindly made the yard and sandbox available for our kids to play in. This was a beautiful neighborhood and a great place to use as a 'base camp' for our week in Denver.  Highly recommend- thanks Nancy."
6515185,436263838,2019-04-12,53937811,Chris,Great location with all the things required for a stay. The pair are a lovely couple. I’d love to come stay again if I was in town.
22628826,282938382,2018-06-28,25375819,Lee,Great spot and ideal location! I recommend this apartment and would be back. 
3791631,77653503,2016-06-02,29095409,Balbir,every thing was as described and very comfortable and very conveniently located to down town area eateries and shopping.
16660933,131574874,2017-02-12,39822722,Marlow,"Mark's place was just lovely. Just far enough away from main streets to be quiet, buy close enough to get where you're going. And the balconies were great to relax on a nice Colorado evening. Would definitely recommend 100%. Thank you Mark!"
15802763,230969877,2018-01-29,167931047,Amy,Great place and location
22638292,539147480,2019-09-30,31345815,Alyssa,Jacqueline’s place was perfect for our weekend in Denver. She sent tips for restaurants and things to do that were nearby. We tried a few of the spots she recommended and they were great! She responded to questions quickly and was always willing to help. We’d definitely stay at her place again.
21042587,406231469,2019-01-28,123570706,Joshua,"Very roomie. Loved the location and the parking space if needed. We enjoyed our time out on the patio. Had a problem with the fire pit working. (Propane) the place was very nice looking, clean, and the beds were amazing!"
23308643,420154471,2019-03-05,2269543,Bettina,Rob’s flat was even more lovely and well-appointed than the pictures suggest. A wonderful place from which to explore Denver!
15948617,306480320,2018-08-12,82174169,Amanda,This house is amazing! It is perfect for big groups of people. There is so much stuff to look at and really has a great vibe. Rosalia is also a great host! Would stay again! We love the lavender house!!
18596199,240914851,2018-03-06,25918930,Shanaya,"Elizabeth’s place was fantastic! It was clean, well kept and stocked with everything you’d need. Two things stood out to me at her place that may be areas of concern for others; the downstairs apartment has no control over the heat or the air and there is very little sound barrier between the upstairs and downstairs apartment. If those things aren’t a concern for you, you will love renting this place! It’s stunning. And the bathroom is a dream! I’d definitely recommend Elizabeth’s place to anyone visiting Denver."
31587928,443801325,2019-04-26,211737902,Brent,Great value for the money. The room was very clean and they were super nice folks.
22139867,252904858,2018-04-12,179677836,Andrew,"We had a fantastic stay at Laura’s place! It was clean, and a perfect size for the two of us. Laura was quick with communication, and never failed to answer a question. Great place, great value, would recommend!"
29461062,410779370,2019-02-10,242138001,Dany,Muy padre pero unas personas huelen mal entonces compartir cuarto aveces no es la mejor opción
20587440,318503220,2018-09-03,206023145,Gary,"You can expect a clean, quiet, comfortable stay, with easy access to the downtown area! And if you enjoy having dogs around, even better!"
18509437,332608961,2018-10-05,170261748,Jerolyn,Paul is a great host. The place was as expected and the location was wonderful for walking to downtown. Paul was very understanding in regards to unexpected change in reservation due to an allergy issue that occurred with one of my guests staying with me. I would stay here again and recommend to friends.
31039806,368892504,2019-01-08,110365882,Lauren,"Very clean, cute, shared space. Rene is a phenomenal host and responds quickly. The area of this Airbnb was a little rough around the edges. Great place for a great price."
6436594,461010842,2019-05-30,134667832,Jack,The floor was a little dirty especially under the bed but otherwise a great place! Good location and nice vibes
19503543,185469987,2017-08-21,4336385,Demetrius,"Getting to Kinga's property is very accessible from airport via RTD. I had no problem finding the property. There are a lot of local bars and great restaurants within walking distance. There are a lot of homeless people on Colfax, but I never felt threatened, and I've seen worser. For others that may be a turn off, keep that in mind when booking. Also, it's not exactly that close to downtown if you don't have a car. And depending on the surge it could be a $5 to 15 dollar lyft ride. You can take the bus, but it's a lot of homeless people near bus stop. I would not recommend for faint of heart. Other then that, the actually apartment is great, satin sheets, and a nice patio. Enjoy! "
4766503,142964291,2017-04-09,21190991,Mike,"If all hosts performed as well as Laurel and Paul then other travel sites would go out of business. I loved every moment that I stayed. Their place felt just like home. If this is available, stop shopping and book now."
18355719,244854082,2018-03-19,21787587,Elena,Sarah's place was very clean and comfortable. Diego her kitty is super friendly and playful. It was a great location and she gave me lots of suggestions on places and things to do.
3541671,152312087,2017-05-15,61872506,Letha,You can't beat the location of this place. The brewery and coffee shop across the street are both great and the house is very nice and clean. I would stay here again.
8366762,100953377,2016-09-11,90980864,Lisa,"I think the hosts described the place accurately. It was cozy the bed was great! Glad there were fans. After a day out and about with windows closed the apartment was stuffy. It took till middle of the night to cool it down.  The shower was great, amenities such as shampoo, etc were nice.

Meka has of one the cleanest homes that I've ever seen. His response time is the best that I've ever seen. Meka is a friendly, considerate, and generous person.

I would recommend Meka's beautiful home to those that appreciate cleanliness, contemporary living, and African Art. 

Thank you Meka,

I was staying here on a school trip and spent most of my time studying, but enjoyed walking around the neighborhood looking at the houses or running around city park on breaks. Very comfortable place, and Michelle is very responsive if any questions or issues arise. I’ll definitely stay here again!"

7497461,125585345,2017-01-06,97956267,Stefano,"The apartment is not far from union station. You can catch a bus, use uber or walk as I did. I had not had the chance to actually meet Carly, but she's always been replying to my texts giving me advice when needed. The apartment is unique very clean, I personally loved it! It's not big but it has everything someone would need."

29359310,522099909,2019-09-01,2829939,Johanna,"Our stay in Denver was easy breezy, thanks to great and clear communication from the host, a clean and beautiful house in a cute, walkable neighborhood. My group of 5 girlfriends and I took advantage of the awesome back yard for group dinners and hanging out. The place was plenty big, with super comfortable beds and a very large master bathroom upstairs that made it easy to share. I would absolutely stay here again!"
23577497,491109762,2019-07-19,14335795,Emmeline,"I can't say enough good things about Jordan and Aleah's place! My group of 5 loved our stay at their home. Everything was even better than we imagined - enough sleeping space for everyone, great kitchen to cook in, and a cute backyard area to have a drink. The dining area upstairs only had space for 4 at the table, so something to keep in mind if your party is larger. We came during an especially hot week in Denver, so the upstairs loft got a bit warm, but it wasn't too much of a bother. Parking is easy on the street and the house is walkable to some awesome spots. Super easy to get around and neighborhood felt safe to walk around. I would wholeheartedly recommend their home to any prospective travelers. Thanks for making our stay so great!"
29337638,425240451,2019-03-17,5300819,Sunny,"Stop looking, you found your place to stay! Kristen’s home is adorable, clean, safe and in a great location. She spoils her guests with kind gestures above and beyond the expectations of any air bnb. As a woman traveling alone, I couldn’t have landed in a better spot. If I return to Denver, I won’t hesitate to stay here again, feels like home."

21182492,249077998,2018-04-01,5523840,Nicole,"The place is exactly as pictured! It was clean, spacious, and had enough amenities for us to get by the one night that we stayed there. Grant was super responsive to our messages and gave us great instructions. The only problem we had was finding parking but (to be fair), we read those reviews prior to booking and knew it'd potentially be a problem. Also, it was walking distance to Cheesman Park. Our pup was a huge fan!"

28016001,347745990,2018-11-11,5364756,Elizabeth,"Matt & Cassie's place is very comfortable and clean and a classic downtown loft.  It is in a great central neighborhood with light rail across the street.  This is their *home* but they have impeccable taste and it is not cluttered, nor  does not feel like a stark vacation rental.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  If you are allergic to cats, just know cats do live here ~ but you would never really know it.  I am allergic and had no issues!"

It was super clean, stylish, full of extra amenities and we loved the location which was perfect for us to walk to great cafe's and restaurants. And a short trip to downtown and other cool areas of Denver! We had our 1 year old toddler with us as well, and Matt provided a great pack n play and the house made it super easy for us to have him running around without hurting himself too much. We can not recommend this enough! And we hope to come back soon!"

The bed was super comfy, the space was really cool and had everything that you would need- perfect for 1 person or a couple! It was a little hard to find because it’s in an alley, but everything else was awesome!"
26130771,294893341,2018-07-22,189828195,Frank,"This bed and breakfast is in a hip, fast-growing section of Denver and is a couple of blocks from very vibrant nightlife, coffee shops, etc, not to mention walking distance to Coors Field and all other things downtown.  The space is very stylish and clean and with a high-tech security system to make guests feel safe.  The main house has a very cool outdoor rooftop patio for gatherings and allows guests the ability to meet other travelers, if interested.  I greatly enjoyed my time and would definitely look to stay again during my next Denver visit!"

The location was great- I was able to walk to get coffee and it never took longer than 5 minutes to get a Lyft, even at 6:30am on Sunday when I headed back to the airport. The neighborhood was safe and quiet and I liked that you could access the space from the alley behind the house. The bed was very comfortable and the TV was easy to use. I will definitely be back!"

It was only 10 minutes from the airport and just a few minutes away from walmart, the supermarket, gas station and a variety of retail, fast food, Walgreens and Dunkin. It was half hour from Denver and from the Red Rocks Amphitheater. For sure this will be my go to apartment when I go back to Colorado. My son calls it his Colorado home lol!"

Walking distance to LoDo and the baseball field we had no trouble getting around DENVER. He was very attentive to our needs...

James has the place decorated perfectly and you immediately feel ""at home"" as soon as you arrive. The keypad entry worked flawlessly and made our late arrival a non-issue. As if that wasn't enough, James included extra towels, sheets, and even an air mattress for our group. His responsiveness was also lightning fast. In short, you won't find a better Airbnb experience."

He was also very prompt and consistent in communicating and made my entire stay flow very smoothly. He gave me a tour of his beautiful house along with some history of the neighborhood and the city. My room had a very comfortable twin bed and everything from the room to the bathroom was very clean. He even encouraged me to use the rest of the house as I wished, which was great to get some work done. Again, I cannot emphasize enough how beautifully designed his house is. Added to my overall experience of Denver in general."

The apartment is in the basement of the house and is definitely bigger than the pictures make it seem! Street parking in the neighborhood is very easy if you have a car with you. We had plenty of space, the bed and sofa were super comfy, the kitchen had everything we could want including a Keurig, tea, hot water maker, microwave, mini fridge, and hot plate for cooking! The shower was really nice, and there's a big closet to hang up clothes and keep things. Kelsey and her family live above, and we could here them walking around or playing above us sometimes during the day (nothing too loud or obnoxious) and at night it was very quiet and peaceful for sleeping!"

Coffee, breakfast, phone chargers, and extra towels and blankets were all provided. It’s no wonder because Mitch was a very generous host, offering restaurant suggestions (confirmed: delicious) and even helping us with our Denver housing search. We loved being able to walk from the house to coffee shops, restaurants, and shops on Pearl and Broadway.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it."

His place is unglamorous, but was the perfect place to crash for a few nights while I explored Denver. Would definitely stay again!"

We had no problem using uber and lyft to get around. The room was perfect we loved the twin beds. The home was 420 friendly and that was a big thing for us.

We never had a problem finding parking on the street right around the corner. The front porch was awesome to hang out on during the evenings and enjoy the Denver sunsets.
25897737,460589168,2019-05-29,50521037,Brandi,You can’t beat this location. You can get to many restaurants and stores from Alex’s place. Just enough space for two people.

18227184,369218765,2019-01-09,222638605,Mark,"This is a squeaky-clean home located very convenient to downtown Denver. The hosts are super responsive and pleasant. 

On the AirBNB spectrum from ""house"" to ""hotel,"" this is pretty far toward the ""house"" end: The hosts will ask you to remove your shoes while inside, and you'll find a comprehensive (but reasonable) list of rules to keep while staying and at check-out. Also, the house is home to a gentle dog who may follow you around and scratch at your door. For most this is not an issue, just something to be aware of.

The bed is very comfortable and the shower works great. The decor is stylish. Amenities are orderly and new. There's a thoughtful basket of treats in the room and the charging station at the desk is a welcome surprise.

Overall a very nice experience."
21662868,458159934,2019-05-25,258905513,Fonofili,First time experience has to be the best experience and this is one place & a super host you wont regret. I slept like a baby on my stay n even didn't want to go out at lease one day of my vacation. The place was huge n quite. Jason is a 420 granola type of guy....lol Made sure I was taken care of n has knowledge n resources for activities of the town. Certainly will be back to use his service.
9110814,456514077,2019-05-21,86163758,Craig,"Really clean, perfect house. Everything is just as it seems in the pictures. The bed is very comfortable. Parking is easy right outside the house, there is food, groceries, and coffee places in walking distance.  Adam, Brittany, and their dog were very welcoming and kind. Would definitely stay here again!"
18535441,328259950,2018-09-25,15644104,Peter,"Patrick was a great host, communicated well, and the place is well situated, close to the arts district (RiNo) and downtown. The area appears to be gentrifying, and we felt safe and secure in the home. We had our own vehicle, but getting around by Lyft/Uber would not be an issue. European-styled 3 level home was clean and had a great open balcony up top for a nice view."
12685709,492966048,2019-07-21,70038606,Marc,Great place! Great location! Right in the heart of RiNo! Walking distance to all the breweries
29905999,509522821,2019-08-14,26322150,Kevin,"Fun place (modern and eclectic)...lots of added amenities and well stocked for our longer stay...neighborhood is transitional with homeless/transient population and related services nearby so it might not be for everyone...we are familiar with this type of neighborhood so we really enjoyed the up and coming restaurants/breweries/coffee shops, etc."
21782254,231326509,2018-01-31,36570831,Coil,"Paulas place is absolutely gorgeous- clean and comfortable beds and appliances. Paula provided some waters and snacks as well as a friendly folder that listed all the local attractions, bars, and restaurants including their favorites! Street parking was easy and seemed secure.

30530431,467706572,2019-06-10,37683744,Angela,"The place was perfect for our quick trip! We came from Washington and my brother came from California to visit my mother. Turns out we were 10 minutes away from her place. Lots of space - the bedrooms, the living room, kitchen, etc were great! The front porch and back yard were awesome places to hang out. Walking distance to the zoo and City  Park. Easy parking out front. Quiet neighborhood with lots of people walking their dogs. Monday I did noticed more cars go by since it’s close the hospital. The listing says no  A/C but it did have a window unit. Super cute house. Neighbors were nice and quiet. Only thing I would’ve loved is another half bath or bathroom on the main level. My mom couldn’t get up the stairs when she came to visit us, but that’s ok. She loved the house! Chris and Jen were so fast and easy to communicate with. Would stay here again for sure!"
22533206,459674915,2019-05-27,211701811,Hannah,this place was beautiful! close by to many things so you can just walk there. Aundrea and James were super friendly and gave me great places to go!
7600940,470838379,2019-06-16,12906167,Adam,Place was great for 9 dudes on a bachelor trip. Backyard kept us at the house more than we expected — perfect on a summer day. Would absolutely recommend to anyone that’s in town and wants a solid place for the crew to chill

The apartment was clean and Kyle and Britany were wonderful hosts.  I especially liked having all the options for different types of pillows, which made for a better nights sleep."
20211505,245547130,2018-03-22,169925344,Colin,"Leon was very knowledgeable about not only Denver but also the areas even an hour away. The house was amazing, clean, and in a great location. We would love to stay with him again in the future."
9842499,100146427,2016-09-07,86162311,Karen,"Gina was wonderful. While she couldn't be around when we arrived, she left us brownies and made sure she contacted us ahead of time to let us know she wouldn't be there.
Everything was clean, warm and inviting and Gina was great to talk to and a gracious host. She even shared some of her homemade grape juice with our 3-year old!
I recommend this place, for sure!"

3645091,239423845,2018-03-01,1270038,Lisa,"Keith's place is cozy and clean and perfect for our six week stay. We loved the Sunnyside neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants and a grocery nearby. Keith went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed during our stay and was quick to communicate whenever we had a question about anything.  We highly recommend a stay in this Sunnyside cottage."
19120025,535139355,2019-09-23,186050301,Hans,"This place is absolutely fantastic! Great location and very modern amenities. Anything that we needed was either a short walk or e-scooter ride away. So many great food options and places to just hangout and relax in the area. 

The pictures make the place look smaller than it actually is in my opinion. And you can't beat that rooftop. Best one in at least a half mile radius. Board games at the house and a mini fridge on the third floor leading up to the rooftop were great touches. Would highly recommend a stay here."
22769182,457265282,2019-05-23,111317675,Jake,"Close to rail, exactly as described."

32308946,538509905,2019-09-29,59923816,Alyson,"Candice's place was great! It was walking distance from most all of the things we were doing, both in RiNo and downtown (if a long walk). It felt as though we had a completely separate space, but with the benefit of a host that was willing to provide recommendations. The space was beautifully decorated with great artwork and very cozy."
10500808,214082961,2017-11-24,42849655,Heather,"Emily’s home is perfect!! Such a cozy place, perfect for couples. I spent more time at this Airbnb than any other in the past; that’s how comfortable it was to be in. Probably the most comfortable bed I’ve experienced too out of my past experiences with Airbnb. Very clean, a good location too. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
13447168,279125329,2018-06-19,172717424,Katherine,"Judy and Marty's place was unlike anything I have ever stayed in. The amount of amenities we're astounding. There really wasn't anything better you could ask for. It is in a wonderful location within Denver. They are our first Airbnb, and it is safe to say we will never choose a hotel again!"
28254270,443798613,2019-04-26,70490631,Katharine,"The location is great! Really nice area, my friends and I walked around Congress park for meals, bars, and fun things around Congress Park that David had suggested. You're a quick drive from Denver LoDo and a bunch of great parks/ local attractions (Denver Zoo, Botanical Gardens, etc.). 

Also, didn't realize driveways were such a hot commodity in Denver/ Congress Park area... That being said, David's got one! If you're bringing a car, you'll have a place to park it, which was really convenient."
16065774,215430586,2017-11-29,7323849,Olivia,"Great place to stay for a great price! Room was very comfortable with a full sized bed and a small table. Plenty of space in the fridge to store food items. Bathroom was clean and always available when I needed it and toiletries were provided. Street parking was a breeze - often I parked right in front of the house, and Stephanie provides a parking pass. Great communication both in messages and in person!"

The four bedrooms were all comfortable, and there were two nice balconies on the top floor, which offered different views. It was only a few minutes from downtown Denver, but the best part of this location was the neighborhood and the many nearby restaurants. We would definitely choose to stay here again on our next trip to the Denver area."
19293155,356268448,2018-12-07,859749,Barry,"What a perfect Air BnB stay. Allan is a wonderful host and offers so many extra touches. A complimentary bottle of wine was even awaiting me upon arrival.

8556263,518972162,2019-08-27,58387045,Dave,"This is a great place! It's new, has plenty of space for one or two people, great amenities, and is in a perfect LoHi location where you can walk to everything within a few blocks. Hosts were gracious and responsive too. As other reviews have noted, the apartment is located underneath a townhome and you can hear people walking and talking above you. It didn't bother me but this might not be the best place for a quiet romantic getaway. I'm still giving it 5-stars for all the other fantastic features!"
27425457,434793138,2019-04-08,58605226,Nikki,"The house was exactly as described. We had a great time relaxing in the backyard and enjoying the firepit.

Matthew was incredibly hospitable showing me around the place when I arrived and providing great company while cooking in their beautiful kitchen. Received a true Denver local experience -- great they included me in their Halloween party plans and that I had access to their rooftop overlooking Denver. Highly recommend this place for any solo female traveler!

The bed and the couch were comfortable for sleeping. There was much to appreciate- a bag of ice in the freezer that we used throughout our stay, wine & beer in the evening, tasty pastries and juices and yogurt for breakfast, the private, comfortable back patio, and more. We appreciated having easy codes to access the cottage, main house, and gate - it made coming and going very convenient. The neighborhood was vibrant and a delight to explore with many great places to eat or buy food within easy walking distance. My partner, who doesn’t travel much, and is hard to please, thanked me twice for arranging such a great place to stay!"
19671778,228407572,2018-01-19,35701014,Julio Cesar,"Short ride from Airport, close to historic Wildlife Refuge, clean home and quite neighborhood. Clean room and plenty of privacy."
20587440,311155579,2018-08-20,49201049,Rob,"Best AirBnB host hands down!  Very friendly and informative. Gave great tips for in the area of what to eat and what to do. The patio is zen full with the sounds of waterfall coming from the Koi Pond. House full of great amenities. The arcade games were a hit when we wanted to just relax in between adventures. If you’re a dog lover, then you’ll love their 3 dogs!  Friendly and chill. We will definitely stay again!"
13226115,531545756,2019-09-17,184374467,Michelle,"I wouldn’t suggest this place.

First of all, host has some serious attitude. When I first arrived, I asked the host if my room came with a key to my door. He got pretty defensive in our conversation as I was explaining to him that most places had keys if multiple rooms were rented out...and as I was explaining why it’s important to have keys, he got even more defensive by saying  “this isn’t a hotel” and “to be clear, your stuff is no more or less secure than ours.” I told him that we weren’t on the same page. I further explained that while hosts have some security, guests have less in this type of situation especially when the host is not home. (There was one guy renting a room across from me. It seemed like we were the only two in the house that evening). What if someone came into my room without my consent and knowledge? They could just take my stuff and/or bring someone into my room for the day or evening. I was just explaining my point of view (suggesting keys to every door) and the host got really defensive to the point where he said that this was an argument when in reality it was just a discussion. Really blowing things out of proportions. Unnecessary drama...   

Second, place is in bad condition:
- bathroom door doesn’t close all the way
- bed squeaks really loud
- towels had stains
- towel hangers aren’t properly installed 
- and more..."

17325994,274259766,2018-06-08,20491503,Zach,This place was amazing and then some. I wish I could have spent more time at the actual house because it was that cool. Keith is amazing and Archer is even cuter in person.

7843605,468515582,2019-06-12,131939542,Michael,This is a basement room.  The bed has a soft foam top and is pretty comfortable.  There is a lot of open space and the kitchen is really nice.  If you need to do laundry on an extended stay that is also available.  I highly recommend trying out the hot tub.
32631589,531483927,2019-09-17,35878187,Shannon,Joe’s place is a great place to stay in Denver. This was our first time using Airbnb and everything went super smooth. His place was clean and offered everything we might need. We had our 3 year old with us and I would consider this to be kid friendly. Very clean and super quiet! Thanks Joe!
5956309,147437210,2017-04-26,47665478,Bryan,"Alex's house is a great, affordable option. Highly recommended for one or two people on a short stay. Alex was very hospitable and gave a great bar recommendation. Couldn't ask for a nicer host. The room was clean and exactly as advertised. The rest of the house was clean and had all the essentials.

24016932,507684283,2019-08-11,124217112,Amy,"This was our 2nd stay at Kyndi's and it was just as fabulous as the first time. She is super accommodating (early check-in if possible) and responsive. You'll find everything you need and more in her home. If you're attending an event at Bronco's stadium you can walk to and from down 17th and over to her street. It will take 20-25 minutes but might be worth it. We attended a concert with 85,000 other people there and it was much easier and quicker to walk back rather than wait in traffic. We also visited Boulder, Golden, Red Rocks and Estes Park. So much is within driving distance of her home. Thank you Kyndi!"
20831478,539614494,2019-10-01,239855578,Andrew,Was a beautiful home and host was wonderful! Definitely stay at this home if you are in the area! A+

The space is stylishly decorated and offers room for everyone to have space.  The kitchen is adequately appointed and the basics are ready for your arrival, i.e. coffee, cereal.  The back yard area is lovely and lets guest enjoy the great Denver weather."
6141491,534516274,2019-09-22,24335334,Barbara,"Brian’s home felt like home to us almost right away. He bent over backwards to accommodate some rather unusual circumstances for us, letting us check in early and checking with us by text or phone call during our stay. 

Brian was on hand to let us in and show us around when we arrived. 

There are four comfortable bedrooms, two of them with private baths, but we didn’t feel crowded. It was perfect for our extended family. When we ate in, we found the kitchen well stocked with plates, flatware and basic foods.

The setting may be described as typical suburban, but within a mile or so are all the big box stores, groceries, restaurants and anything else you might need or want.

If you have a chance to avail yourself of his hospitality, I highly recommend you do so."
15469884,265611884,2018-05-17,162805553,Laura,Frances’ place is exceptionally clean and well-kept. The place is beautiful and modern. The surrounding neighborhood is amazing and parking is never a hassle.

18535441,463114499,2019-06-02,15271423,Eliot,"Patrick's home was a great place to spend a weekend in Denver! Only about 5 blocks from Larimer, we were able to explore all the awesome bars, restaurants, and breweries that RINO has to offer on foot. There's a nice park nearby too so the walk to Larimer is super pleasant. 

The place is perfect for two couples because each bedroom has its own floor and own bathroom. As an added bonus, the two bedrooms are nearly identical so you don't have that classic awkward airbnb situation where you arrive and one couple has to sleep on bunk bends while the other couple gets a beautiful suite with a king bed.

Finally, Patrick was a great host. He lived next door and was available if we needed him but wasn't overbearing or intrusive in any way. We would absolutely stay here again on a future visit to Denver!"
3395085,48037817,2015-09-22,33154825,Tricia,I stayed with Jenni for a week. She and her family were wonderful. They made me feel right at home. Jenni made recommendations for local things to do.

We were able to cook and relax so comfortably after a day of skiing. When we hung out locally, we were close to everything! We could Uber for cheap or walk. The bus was also close by! Couldn’t be a better location! And Jim, the host, was very hospitable and kind. I would 100% stay here again!"

14800540,453019054,2019-05-14,38905159,Erica,Kathryn's place is possibly the best value I've ever gotten out of an airbnb. Location is perfect and Kathryn made the space so comfy for me and my guest. I genuinely enjoyed my stay and will recommend her space to others who are visiting the area.
4909321,74124041,2016-05-13,16212058,Ray,"This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was a good one!  Rebecca was an excellent hostess.  Not only was the accommodation everything as advertised, Rebecca even picked us up at the nearby light rail station.  The location was well-situated for our purposes: a long weekend visiting Denver.  The home was clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  Highly recommended."

Do be aware that the apartment is subterranean and lets in very little light - even during bright sunny days. But if you're on the go, it's perfect. Very clean, full functioning kitchen and the Wifi is solid!"
20624536,206048880,2017-10-23,21419366,Aimee,This place is even better than the pictures can show! Decor was modern and stylish. Everything was extremely clean. They provided extra amenities comparable to a nice hotel. Having a designated parking spot in this popular Denver location was ideal. Josh and Kerrie were very welcoming and friendly hosts and were immediately available via text or in person whenever we had questions. This house had EVERYTHING we needed for our long weekend including a full sized washer and dryer. We would definitely stay here again!

21177846,205688350,2017-10-22,51082585,Bryce,"This is a *perfect* base to tour Denver. First, it's a cool space - private from the main house, separated by a small, shared yard that's a great space to relax. (Bonus: It's a short Uber ride from almost anywhere downtown.)

Secondly, Stephanie is fantastic. She asked about coffee preferences, provided bottled water and other treats in the fridge and showed a genuine concern about making sure the trip was special. And ... she offered spot-on recommendations for dinner (one of the best places we'd ever been to) and brunch. She also was happy to talk about anything you wanted, from seating strategies at Red Rocks concerts to neighborhoods to explore.

Five stars across the board. We'll be back!"

My family and I (6 people) stayed here and we had plenty of space to sleep, cook, and relax.  This place is pretty close to down town Denver (only ~$4 Uber ride) and the home has street parking right in front of the house.  A grocery store is just across the street as well.  "

We stayed there with one other couple on our first visit to Denver and it was the perfect amount of space for the four of us. We loved the decor, the place was immaculately clean and provided us with everything we needed. We didn't have a rental car but it was only a 10 min uber/lyft ride to anywhere we wanted to go in the city, and we walked to a few of the spots nearby (highly recommend Sunny's and El Jefe). Would definitely stay here again!"

It also had basic stuff like coffee, sugar, salt and cooking oil if you are planning to cook some meals here. David and the rental company were easy to work with and were quite prompt in their responses. The place does look smaller in person than the pictures but, that did not affect our stay in any way. We had an issue opening the garage but the rental company responded right away with a workaround. The location is very close to several restaurants and bars but the street is quiet and we didn't have any issues with noise."

We’ve been using AirBnb for many years and have almost always had great experiences but Bill and Rita’s place stands out as the best experience we’ve had. The home is beautiful and meticulously clean. Anytime we found ourselves wanting for something it was there - coffee, bandaids, Motrin for a headache, toys and books for the kids. And not just any toys and books - some of our favorite books from home we’re there. Our kids also enjoyed the outdoor tubs and we spent hours out there in them several days.

The hosts were extremely responsive but not intrusive at all. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. "

I’m happy with the quick-easy trusting communication I had with Radhika. The place itself was comforting and would book another trip to Denver in this AirBnB again without a doubt."

5508545,56827606,2015-12-18,31468397,Alice,My friend and I had a quick layover with  Darja. She was very friendly and let us use her computer to watch a movie. My only concern was the air mattress bed. It was rather cold but I ended up using the couch and slept comfortably. Thank you Darja.

18177763,340014458,2018-10-22,4290202,Maggie,"This cute home was everything we hoped for, and was comfortable for 2 couples for a long weekend.  We walked to a beer fest near the River North/Cole districts.  We hired transportation to a great restaurant across the river in the Highland area.  All in all, a great stay, and because there was parking in the garage, we rented a car for the long weekend to get out to the mountains.  We did not use the outdoor space, but it was nice to have it.  Also really great to have a full kitchen, with glasses and dishes, and nice to have Wifi and TV options.  Thanks!"

22795235,346181934,2018-11-07,53605340,Erin,"Overall this place is great! It was clean with a well stocked kitchen. The bathroom had plenty of towels and full size shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. You can hear people walking upstairs but it was never loud enough to be bothersome. The living room is small but worked well for our visit. I would definitely stay here again."

3479122,145737166,2017-04-19,4009439,Andrew,One of the most unique layouts I've seen among dozens of AirBnB stays. Perfect location if you're planning to attend a Rockies game. Wish I had more time to sit outside and enjoy the courtyard!
3742687,527778209,2019-09-11,42111265,Shelley,Awesome place! So adorable and about a 10-minute walk to restaurants. Amazing host! Amazing location!
16313550,236193971,2018-02-18,27236202,Emil,Great location - 1 block to restaurants and clubs - Angelos for great Italian. Good value. Some TLC would make it perfect
6730800,57902048,2015-12-30,48905379,Anne & Joe,We found this cute little house a perfect fit for our family's Christmas vacation. We could walk to restaurants and bars or we could easily access the highway for a day on the ski slopes or hope on the light rail to go to the football game. The house was well equipped with most of the comforts of home and the neighborhood was very safe and quiet. Rob and Nikki stayed in touch to assure we got settled in or answer any questions we had. We would definitely consider staying there on another visit.
18811589,281427636,2018-06-24,182492225,Trisha,"Marlene and Doug are amazing and very personable and wonderful people! Gave us all kinds of tips!

5402378,121022384,2016-12-13,75318074,Ali,The house was perfect for our 10 day stay in Denver. It has a great backyard and was a comfy and cozy place to stay! We would definitely return if we are ever back in Denver! 
14932614,323494875,2018-09-15,172890688,Tammy,"Joseph's home was fabulous! Very clean, perfectly comfortable mattresses, pillows & furniture. The adorable yard/porch area has a grill and was a great place to visit, eat and enjoy cocktails at the end of the evening. The kitchen was well stocked for everything you need to stay, eat, cook & grill at the home. He answered every question I had instantly! We travel ALOT and have rented homes rather than hotels for years with 4 people to 22 people (kids & grandkids) all over the US. Although this one was an extraordinarily short stay with only 4 of us for a concert, this was one of the best experiences we have had. Owner went out of his way to add extra touches for us! The bowl of fresh fruit, milk & juice in the fridge- even pasties and cereal! I would highly recommend this home when you need one in Denver! Great location to many places of interest. For a last minute weekend rental with MANY events going on right near the home, this was also a great price! Thank you Joseph!"
14058998,351115117,2018-11-21,33365963,Justin,The perfect stay for anyone visiting Denver.  The host took the time to understand what you enjoy (and don't) in order to offer the best recommendations of things to do.  Jackie was so accommodating with anything you need and the place was immaculate with a ton of space.  Highly recommend any of her listings.
24183381,350892880,2018-11-20,37845696,Kristopher,Phil's apartment was gorgeous and clean. We enjoyed spending mornings by the fireplace and even venturing onto the rooftop deck in the cold! Phil was very responsive when the coffeemaker broke and had a new one delivered that same day. I highly recommend this spot.
16582485,188252190,2017-08-28,35963720,John,"Great location! Cindy was a great host, however the trains outside were so, soooooo so so so loud. Not Cindys fault at all. Seriously a great location."

13041992,551988818,2019-10-20,65129356,Kristina,Jack’s place was an excellent spot to stay while in Denver for a conference! It was only about a 25 minute walk to downtown area and less than a $10 lift ride. The space is very stylish with beautiful exposed brick. The bathroom was large and everything was spotless. Jack was an excellent host and easy to contact. I’d definitely stay there again!
27661742,496662977,2019-07-27,233356999,Arielle,"This space was great and Escher was so quick to respond and easy to reach. You can tell he takes pride in his space, it was immaculate. He also kindly left cookies out for us for when we got there and answered any and all questions prior to my trip. The place was great and there were instructions everywhere concerning where everything was and pretty much answering any questions we may have: where extra towels were, how to use the remotes and AC, where kitchen plates could be found, etc. I would stay here again in a heartbeat"

861993,151216209,2017-05-11,49262633,Nadia,"John and Shann's place is cozy. You have everything you need to make your stay comfortable. It's not a quiet place during the day -- you can hear the hosts moving around upstairs. They have an active dog that runs around having fun. We weren't bothered by either since we did not spend much time during the day ""at home."" We loved being able to walk to Sloan's Lake in the mornings. They provide you with a residential street parking permit which was great since we had a car rental. All the spots we wanted to visit were within a 10-15 min drive. "
27064399,538348823,2019-09-29,147676201,Mykola,"Great place, awesome owner."
1153002,53883076,2015-11-14,5686411,Tamara,"Kim's house was lovely and spacious enough to accommodate the three of us, who were all sleeping in separate bedrooms. It's unusual to find a place with three bedroom and real beds! The neighborhood is fairly residential, but it is a short walk from shops, cafes, and restaurants on Larimer Street. Uber rides from the house were so inexpensive that we ended up taking them to and from our downtown conference hotel. We all had a very pleasant stay! "
23355811,502438653,2019-08-04,129150730,Christie,"Great spot, tastefully decorated, very comfortable. This was our first trip using Airbnb and it was great. Communication was excellent- Alex and his team were prompt and proactive."
29324718,504373028,2019-08-07,14851900,Sarah,Christopher's place was exactly as I expected. His instructions were very clear and accurate. He even gave me a heads up that parking was effected by construction and offered solutions.

787456,238946000,2018-02-27,24304749,Laura,"We loved Pam’s place! It was such a breeze getting into the place and communicating.  She let us leave our bags there before we checked in since we were coming from another airbnb.  The living space was funky and cozy at the same time, and although it was a short trip, we enjoyed the time we did spend at the house.  Also loved being greeted by the chickens! There was water and fruit in our room when we arrived.  We went to the botanical gardens across the street - definitely recommend! Great Airbnb experience - would definitely recommend. :)"
18616037,194378768,2017-09-16,49174685,Johnathan,"Really great location. We were not too far from anything. Very central. Quiet neighborhood. Nice park near by. Target, Walgreen, and Chick-fil-A near by so that was a plus for us. House was very clean and offered all the amenities you need being away from home. Very good communication and was enjoyable to stay. Fit 6 guys on a weeklong fishing trip very comfortably. Only 1 shower but we made it work. Overall a nice experience."
6515185,97251433,2016-08-26,22134312,Liz & Jeff,"We really enjoyed their place. It was close to fun places for food and hanging out. The rooftop patio is crazy fun. We used their grill, and that made life easy! The shower is awesome. We loved visiting with Monica. It was a few blocks away from our son. I can't think of a thing I would change or suggest. "
23395457,472957137,2019-06-20,53229795,Stanley,"Best stay in an air bnb ever!  Place was clean, comfy and convenient!  All of the amenities are there plus above and beyond cleanliness and appointments.  Can’t say enough about the quality, clean bedding!  Kudos Allison!"
13171401,167116494,2017-07-05,40806256,Jess,"It was such a treat to have such a large, clean, and comfy space to ourselves as we were given the entire downstairs. From the bedroom to the living room to the bathroom everything was luxurious. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the backyard but it looked like an awesome place to hang out. The home& garden is beautiful! "
4067759,41492750,2015-08-07,37766614,Lauren,"I stayed with Erika for 3 nights, a little shorter than the majority of her guests. I came to Denver for a short laid back trip to experience a new city, and Erika's place was perfect for that! As others have said, it's in a great spot, one of the best in the area from what I heard from locals. Downtown Denver is a 30 minute walk away, and plenty of cute restaurants and bars less than 5 minutes. The inside of the house was clean, cozy, and wonderfully decorated. Erika was a wonderful host during the few days I was there, taking some time to get to know my interests and recommended some great local hot springs! I would GLADLY return!"

I would rate this host will Excellenc, as he went out of his way to ensure I was comfortable and accommodated. Thank you for that! The home was very clean, the private bed was very comfortable with nice linens. Mehdi is a genuine and kind person that deserves the best rating. His home is close to Denver University, the Light rail and other food locations/ shopping as advertised. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to other Airbnb'rs."
36815550,530369069,2019-09-15,205771318,Ronnie,"Every part of the stay was amazing. From the apartment, to the concierge, the gym, pool, access to Whole Foods and CVS, close proximity to the train and entertainment. This is the place to stay. My only hesitation is talking about it, we may not be able to stay here again once the word is out."
98008,3113415,2012-12-18,3131455,Charlene,My daughter and I had an enjoyable time staying with Lindsay.  The queen bed and down comforter where so warm .  I slept great!   We had access to the kitchen where we put some items in the refrigerator and used the toaster oven.   Neighborhood was really nice.  I felt safe there to be sure.   If I am in Denver again I would stay with Lindsay again!

Gary went above the call of duty - providing transport to and from the train station and inviting me to a local, very cool dive bar upon arrival.  Great hospitality in a lovely location.  Highly recommend!"

It's a bit of a walk from the conference center, but we loved the walk after sitting all day. Several coffee shops, a wine shop and a grocery store super close. The apartment was clean and comfortable and Hannah stocked everything we needed in the bathroom and kitchen. We'd love to stay again if/when we're in Denver. Thanks again! "

Susan called and followed up to make sure the stay was perfect. I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs and this was my favorite experience by far. The place itself wasn’t too shabby either- completely updated with all of the amenities and extremely comfortable bed. It’s small, so perfect for a shorter stay. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Highly recommend."

28695010,454124927,2019-05-17,92326031,Rick,"We had a wonderful stay in Stacy's basement apartment. We were there for only one night, where our family converged and staged for a trip farther west. But we wished we could have had longer to enjoy the space and the wonderful back yard. Very clean, all needed amenities, very comfortable, and thoughtful touches like labeled light switches, clear instructions on garbage/recycling. Nice quite location as well. We would definitely go back if we needed a place in Denver again."
2978155,16909469,2014-08-04,9571651,Jacob,"John has a hip pad with great accommodations in a lovely Denver neighborhood just outside of downtown. We only stayed for the night, but checking in was effortless and we didn't have any problems. Would happily rent again."
27688613,342498519,2018-10-28,186286271,Justin,"Location, location, location.  Can't really beat it.  Well worth every penny.  You're not going to Denver to sit inside anyway."
29281503,502488997,2019-08-04,23083341,Ashley,"It was extremely easy to communicate with Barbara, she was very responsive. The location is perfect, close to walkable bars and restaurants and a quick drive to the grocery stores. I did not realize when I booked there would be a small kitchen area which worked out great for us. Super clean and spacious place for the night."
23752317,411201949,2019-02-11,34693771,Hunter,"Hilary and John were wonderful, friendly, and delivered more than promised! They were perfect at giving us as much space as we needed and were always quick to respond to any of our questions!"

16914193,272644297,2018-06-03,183726427,Lillian,This was a cozy little spot to come back each evening after exploring Denver/Boulder/Colorado Springs .... we never got the chance to walk the neighborhood but it looked like the kind of place you would want to walk your dog and check out all the cool homes.  Gary was a great host and we are very grateful !!
18473767,287831082,2018-07-08,57666371,Lauren,"Had a great experience staying at Beatriz's place.  Great location- easily walkable to a bunch of good restaurants, shops and parks.  Clean, comfortable room with all the necessities for a comfortable stay.  Really enjoyed my visit, would absolutely stay here again."

21190064,229627131,2018-01-24,18345480,Ewo,"The Dahlia Inn was a perfect place to stay for my one night in Denver! Check-in was flexible, the home is cozy and clean, and Rachel was very hospitable. A bonus for me was  scheduling a massage from Rachel -- she is a licensed massage therapist who helped relieve the stress in my back after a month of nonstop travel."
33605746,505051982,2019-08-08,65693758,Angela,"Everything as described, and better. 4 people fit comfortably here and we loved our stay. I slept like a baby, the beds were so comfy!
Jesse was always available if we had any questions. Street parking does get a little tight after the sun goes down, but it’s free so not much of a problem for us. It’s close to everything we needed & wanted!
It’s about a 15 minute Uber to the Pepsi Center. There’s a yummy restaurant/bar down the street with Trivia Nights on Monday’s & Wednesday’s which we enjoyed.
The “bumper pool” table (I think that’s what it’s called) in the Airbnb itself was pretty interesting, we tried learning how to play and still had so much fun with it, even though we’re pretty sure our method was incorrect LOL.

We would definitely stay again if Jesse would have us!"
17714215,161363699,2017-06-17,24735290,Clara,"Very clean, Laura is kind and is a great conversationalist if you desire to chat or will leave you alone if that is your choice. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks !"

26349458,425987241,2019-03-19,140925529,Thomas,"Larry's home is great. My wife and I stayed with two other couples, and we were all comfortable in every way. Spacious kitchen and dining area, comfortable beds, pillows, linens, lots of natural light. Furthermore, Larry was a generous host who was flexible amidst the winter storm (dubbed the ""bomb cyclone"") which meddled with our flights. 

Beyond that, we enjoyed the location very much, too. Many good, walkable, dining spots within a few blocks along Logan."
20478140,455585129,2019-05-19,134111230,John,Terrific host. Have stayed with her several times and she always tries to provide excellent hosting. She remembers my requests and has taken care to provide on my next visit. Very clean and organized quarters. Privacy is great with a separate entrance that is lighted with motion sensitive lighting for safe entry after dark. Will check on you by cell text during visit to make sure you have what you need. Would recommend for any person visiting Denver (just not when I want to stay there !).

19208202,289618748,2018-07-12,75998741,Kristin,"my 17 year old son and i enjoyed a great stay here. the home was perfect for what we needed and offered plenty of space to spread out, prepare meals and cool down (for him) after long hot days at a college ID soccer camp nearby. julia was easily accessible and very responsive to any questions that we had. the house was very clean and we appreciated the light breakfast items that were provided as well as the bikes - i enjoyed a lovely ride on the cherry creek trail one day which was less than a mile from the front door. would stay again!"
27394040,325101979,2018-09-18,145399872,Brett,"This house is the best AirBnB I have stayed in. The hosts are incredibly accommodating, did a fantastic job with decorating, and a million times better than a hotel room."
11127739,161332671,2017-06-17,18945525,Valerie,"Erics place was so great for my friends and I staying in Denver for a few nights. :)  We were able to really relax and enjoy ourselves, cooking, listening to music, and even jamming in the house! The house itself is so fun and brightly colored and my friends and I loved that it had everything we needed. Eric was very cool and would hang out with is from time to time as well. "

It's also a quick uber ride to all of the other Denver neighborhoods you may want to check out. No matter which bedroom you stay in, every room is comfortable and spacious. Also, have the extra living space downstairs was great!"

7091323,84084423,2016-07-05,27903636,Vincent,Joseph was an excellent host and the apartment space was exactly as described. I especially appreciated the tour of the house and the willingness to open his kitchen and food to us. Thanks a lot for a great stay in Denver!

18805144,174069957,2017-07-24,28511905,Kelly,"The Baker Farmhouse was the perfect home-away-from-home for my family.  Parking was super easy and Denver is a very drivable city. For those without a car, public transport is minutes away. The Baker Historic district is a fun and friendly neighborhood. The place is small, but very clean and smelled great! It's obvious that David and Brittany are great hosts. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much!!"
3150813,247800225,2018-03-29,172546561,Eric,This place was awesome for 6 guys visiting Denver. We had a great time staying here and not a single complaint about the house. It’s located close to everything and Ubers are so cheap and plentiful in the area if you don’t like to walk. The place is exactly as pictured and was an amazing stay. Definitely plan on returning. Possibly a yearly trip with my buddies! Add a hot tub and you’d have the chillest pad in Denver!
20292902,263697161,2018-05-12,121214597,Maggie,"Close to the airport, clean, and Stephanie was super nice! Would recommend!"

10237203,473428699,2019-06-21,77945,Kim,"Jess's space is really cozy and cute. It's in a convenient neighborhood, with tons of historic charm. Street parking was easy, as was self-check-in. It has a great shower with a ton of hot water. As mentioned elsewhere, there was occasional noise from upstairs, but during reasonable hours. We found it to be a really good home base for our short stay in Denver, and we'd stay here again."
9731001,154470069,2017-05-24,78800758,Karina,Clean place close to the airport. Great stay.

24493881,541656168,2019-10-05,72800387,Macaulie,Eric was a great host and his home was perfect for our stay. The beds were comfy and the yard was a great area for my pup to run around. The basement has a private entrance for convenience. The area is very nice and many places within walking distance. 20 minute drive to downtown and 30-40 minutes to red rocks.
8941796,477679376,2019-06-28,66986243,Cory,Was a great place to stay for a few days in Denver. Recommend for sure.

I came here to attend a conference at the Colorado convention center, and it was so close to get there (in a walking distance) and a perfect location for me. Highly recommend for people who need access to the city. "
20761981,218004409,2017-12-10,1694943,Brandon,"This location really can't be beat, as LoHi is a fantastic neighborhood, and they're next door to the superb restaurant, Root Down. Lots of fun coffee shops nearby, too. The bed was incredibly comfortable.

The hosts are incredibly friendly, affable types, and I enjoyed chatting with them as well as the fact they left me to determine how much we interacted. 

Some FYIs: 
--when the kids are present, the place can get VERY noisy, especially given how sound carries down into the basement where you'll be staying.
--the TV happened to not work for longer than 30 minutes, so know that such amenities are a possible bonus, not an expectation. 
--they have a new puppy they are potty-training. The upside: an adorable puppy greeted me every day! The downside: one night, when heading to the bathroom, I found the puppy had pooped in a couple places along the kitchen floor. It didn't bother me, but I realize others might be thrown. This will be less relevant as the puppy learns!"
19988833,547260361,2019-10-14,40934157,Prachi,Super cute space. Perfect for a short stay. The host was super responsive and kept following up on us. The house has little knickknacks that make you feel at home.

17638962,532416230,2019-09-19,89860918,Jessica,"Skip this place and stay at a privately offered air bnb spot instead. StayAlfred is a large company that randomly gives you any of their apartments in this building, so the photos do NOT match what you get. Mine was supposed to have a balcony but there was none. PARKING wasn’t addressed at all in the description or any of the reviews. I had to call and ask, and they sent me local parking options but not any pricing or real information. I ended up only being able to find one of them and had to wake up at all hours of the night to reload parking via an app as it only allowed a few hours at a time. For a business traveler, this was really unacceptable. There were ballgames almost every night which skyrocketed parking to $30+ for a 6 hour timeframe so it got expensive. Additionally, when I checked out the key return wasn’t working so that was another 20 minute process to call them and figure that out in the midst of rushing to the airport. Totally inconvenient stay that really took away from my productivity."
6226492,44858313,2015-08-29,42329902,Travis,"Great place, thanks for the donuts!"
13171401,102880773,2016-09-19,11109441,Barb,We had a great weekend stay with Shelby and Jon. Their communications were clear and they were friendly and helpful. Their home is lovely and the accommodations were just right for us. We were able to use the city bus to get to and from the downtown events we attended because the location of their home is perfect. They had the coffee waiting when we woke up!

It is kept very clean and tidy, the only thing I noticed was the strong odor of 420 which some was expected but it was very strong, nothing a few open windows and a couple hours couldn’t fix! Overall I would definitely recommend!"

One of the nights we went to a game a Coors Field and it was perfect walking distance. The place was nice, and not too noisy for being right down town. The area I think is up and coming, I don’t know if I’d walk around too much at night in the area. We had brunch at the restaurant right below the place called the Lobby, which had good food!"

13474217,311661201,2018-08-21,119322235,Robert,"Kinga was a wonderful host she responded quickly and even left us a bottle of champagne! This apartment is huge, works perfect for 2-3 couples and has plenty of area for you to keep to yourself if need be! My favorite part is you have a view of downtown Denver out of your shower!"
18501879,297335710,2018-07-27,23897875,Carla,"I 100% enjoyed my stay at Kara's AirBNB. She has clearly considered the needs of her guest, crafting a restful and inviting atmosphere, being available, providing for a variety of needs. I would absolutely stay at her place again."
21412147,339666821,2018-10-21,7766082,Peter,"Luke was a fantastic host to my friends and I. Everything was exactly how it was described. Parking was readily available, the place was clean, washer and dryer in unit. You can hear some creaking above bit it's barely noticeable. All in all, it was a fantastic stay, and would definitely stay here again, given the chance."
548897,20024659,2014-09-22,17621512,Madison,"This small suite is the perfect place to stay for trips to Denver. It has all of the amenities I could ask for and is very close to fun locations in the city like Colfax Ave. where there are a lot of nice restaurants and bars, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and many others. It is also close to several park areas so that you can easily get out and get some exercise. I'd say the suite is the closest thing you could find to a hotel-quality accommodations without paying the hotel price. This place has definitely become my ""home away from home"" whenever I come to Colorado!"
18754423,492737187,2019-07-21,25697108,Anuradha,"I would definitely recommend Natalie’s place for any one visiting Denver. It was sparkling clean, easy to check in and very beautiful."
17845387,459655028,2019-05-27,145205803,Aubrey,"Good location, very accommodating hosts! If you are sensitive to noise, heads up, it’s an older house so you can hear everything going on throughout the house. Great back yard with pool and hot tub - wasn’t the cleanest place we have stayed in."
15282172,271528960,2018-06-01,177640938,Christina,I definitely recommend staying here! It was perfect and has everything you need for your stay. It is also very centrally located to everything you may want to do in Denver. I will be back.
4191778,190654409,2017-09-04,103486456,Brooke,We had a very nice stay at Erin's place. It was very cozy and they were very accommodating and kind. We checked in early and everything was smooth sailing. Plus it's super close to downtown Denver and other fun areas! I would recommend to others.
13209951,175748868,2017-07-29,116169567,Louie,"Exactly as described. It is a economical choice for persons traveling. Thomas is an awesome person and we maintained communication throughout. Place is centralized and many destinations are reachable via public transport, Lyft, etc. Definitely enjoyed my stay. "

3410364,459732887,2019-05-27,13871156,Adriana,"This place is absolutely perfect. It’s close to so many neat restaurants in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Alison and her husband were great hosts, and I would recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Denver. In fact, I’ve already told all of my friends about it!

The bed was super comfortable as were the rest of the accommodations. We loved putting a pin on the map and enjoyed looking through the literature on Denver and Colorado. 

Thanks for a great stay, Alison!"
13175605,127236642,2017-01-16,101121620,Mackenzie,"Jack's place was within a 15-20 minute drive to every place we went (exept the Rocky Mountains)! Lovely, comfortable home with everything we needed! The gate was a nice touch to add for privacy from the road/pedestrians. "
16947747,497771667,2019-07-28,20541535,Ashwini,"We had an excellent stay in the treehouse! Loved all the thoughtful touches and convenient appliances, and the place was spotless. The bed is magical because I slept the best I have in weeks. Also very conveniently located and walkable to downtown, we barely needed a car. Would highly recommend!"

Alex is right and the place is bomb."

26415492,556115887,2019-10-28,17839731,Rene,"If you're wanting to stay in the middle if downtown Denver, Zach's place is what you're looking for. Unfortunately, while we were there the elevators were out of service. Since lofts have high ceilings, you'd need to go up 4 sets of wooden stairs. Just an FYI, in case it happens again. Otherwise, great stay."
3605358,144802811,2017-04-16,11271834,Laura,"Great place - we loved our stay! Very centrally located and close to coffee shops, food, and bars. Georgia even let us check in a couple of hours early - she was so helpful and accommodating. We'll recommend her to anyone traveling to Denver! "

3425065,283325612,2018-06-29,23385307,Jaime,"We had a very good experience at Kimberly's place. It's in a good location to downtown: less than 30 minute walk or short Uber ride. The room is very private. It does get a bit hot, but she has two fans set up in the room, so it's not unbearable. I would stay there again."

I will note that I was stranded due to storms and she was so understanding of my difficulties.  Wonderful host with great hospitality.  I hope to return in the future.  Thanks Sophia!
12990793,229636736,2018-01-24,158686980,Carolyn & Andrew,This was my boyfriend and I's first time doing an airbnb and we couldn't thank Pat enough for giving us such a great experience. The place was a little smaller than we thought but it ended up being perfect for us. Pat was always quick with responses and the overall space was super clean (which was a must for me bc I'm a clean freak). We definitely recommend staying here! You will not be disappointed!!
10995273,244503505,2018-03-18,59929342,Jason,Awesome and updated space...would definitely stay here again!
17752540,363941356,2018-12-29,87594869,Shawn,I have lost count of how many times I have stayed at Jack's places. They never disappoint. Plus Jack is the coolest host ever. For more details see my previous 5 star reviews of Jack's awesome homes.
13569285,84091542,2016-07-05,21774967,Miles,Jan's house was a pleasure to stay in. He was welcoming and communicative and made sure everything went smoothly. I would highly recommend staying in Jan's place.
22889415,301120798,2018-08-03,172264403,Pamela,Erik ‘s place was fantastic. I would highly recommend it. The home is spacious with its three levels. The outside area is private and inviting. I would give it a five star rating. I will tell my family and friends about our great experience!
21725586,535079869,2019-09-23,28572541,Esteban,"Enjoyed a few days at this cool listing in Globeville, Denver. Our host Frank was great and the home is comfortable and nicely designed — an excellent stay when in town. Highly recommend."

8941796,247459861,2018-03-28,115184060,Danielle,The guest house was amazing! A great space for the price. Nice and quiet. Centrally located to awesome restaurants! This was our 1st airbnb experience! We will definitely use the guest house on returning trips to Denver! We did not get a chance to meet Chris. But he checked in with us throughout our stay and answered any questions we had!
5794938,232393266,2018-02-04,53260691,Jillian,"Allan's place was very cozy and in a great location! Just a short walk to both downtown Denver and Colfax Ave! This was our first time in town and he provided us with so many suggestions of places to visit! Was a lovely apartment in a great spot, will definitely be checking in with him again next time we're in Denver!"
11722154,334985226,2018-10-10,12926978,Alec,Great set-up and awesome location. Aj and Kat were always quick to reply! Check-in and check-out were super simple. Would love to stay here again if we are in Denver again.
13449331,121369607,2016-12-16,74696454,David,"Gary's place was exactly as advertised and more! The pictures simply do not do his apartment justice. It is simply amazing how much thought Gary has put into this apartment. You'll find that you have almost everything that you need upon entering. Furthermore, the apartment is very clean with great air filtration and climate control. The property is located in a quiet neighborhood that provides easy access to eateries and entertainment. Lastly, Gary was super responsive and checked in via AirBnB messaging daily to ask if we needed anything. We will definitely be booking again when in Denver. Thanks, Gary!"
7826191,179143375,2017-08-06,41586920,Ben,"Place is ideal. So many great places to walk, Josh had everything there we needed. Would 100% recommend anyone else to check this place out."

20130134,223744371,2018-01-01,164649361,Zachary,"Staying with Juan at Queen Irene's was just what we needed. I nice, cozy, warm place to spend the night. He was very helpful! It was especially nice to take a break and chat with him about his experiences. We look forward to staying with Juan again soon."
35351021,486484866,2019-07-12,15990844,Katie,"We loved our stay at Mitch's place! It's a great location, beautifully decorated room and a sparkling clean private bathroom, and we loved the small kitchenette in the room. The only thing we found a bit tough was the heat as there is no aircon in the room, but the fans did help. Would definitely stay again"
14836832,123318612,2016-12-28,23698413,Regina,The house is fantastic and in a great location! Communication was great :) Thoroughly enjoyed the stay!

And such a friendly puppy! Would definitely stay again if I ever come back to Denver."
31262420,494705127,2019-07-24,39850814,Mathias,"Our stay was very pleasant. The neighbourhood is very nice, the apartment is kept really neat and tidy. Reponse and communication with Bethany is easy and fast. 
I could even stay a bit longer than the official check out to go for a run!
Definitely a place to stay!"

13751968,214878420,2017-11-26,63650587,Brian,I’ve never used Airbnb before this trip and it was honestly great! The place was in a good location and Nadine was amazing and so helpful! The place was cute and cozy I never wanted to leave
17664945,254117621,2018-04-15,35166110,Chrissy,"We loved staying at Randall's place!  The guest space was cozy with all sorts of thoughtful touches, from the binder of local recommendations to the refreshments in the kitchen area.  The laundry facilities also came in handy, letting me wash clothes that had gotten dusty during some unexpected wind gusts while hiking.  Randall was a very accommodating host, unobtrusively messaging to make sure we'd made it safely and had what we needed.  Once we'd settled in, he invited us up for a glass of wine and conversation (and to visit with his two sweet cats).  Great location in a nice neighborhood with plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
142683,466947338,2019-06-09,43076284,Wynter,"This was a nice little townhouse with a good location. The only thing we had complaints about was the AC unit is connected to the owner's other side so when we would try to turn the air up, the owner would turn it down saying her bedroom was freezing and ask us to just open up the windows. The house was 77 degrees and even with windows open we were pretty warm. It was even 59 degrees outside through the night, so I am not sure why our bedrooms were still pretty warm. 

Other than that, cute little house and great host! She was very responsive and quick to answer any issues that we had."
12864305,362982906,2018-12-27,141044836,Greg,"A clean, quiet place centrally located with easy access by road to highways and downtown Denver or by walking a few blocks to a large park, major shopping area or to have a morning cup of coffee."
35879415,495898550,2019-07-26,125439661,Michelle,"I highly recommend Phuoc Dung’s. It was a perfect location for an early morning flight. It’s less then 15 min. From the airport, there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and it’s new, large and clean. Thanks again for having us!"
15674568,213546975,2017-11-21,134139948,Dinah,"The apartment was in excellent condition, had every imaginable amenity (including washer/dryer), and was actually somewhat larger than I had anticipated; the bathroom and kitchen are both spotless and fairly new. I thought the bedroom and bathroom were very cozy, and the kitchen had everything I needed to prepare and eat a number of meals at home during a week-long stay. Despite the proximity to campus, the immediate neighborhood is very quiet. The apartment is, as advertised, a basement apartment and thus a little bit on the dark side, but it felt very private and was ideal as a quiet retreat for me for a work-related stay."
6410804,185043440,2017-08-20,145744027,Aziza,"It was my first time staying at Airbnb and Jerry was an excellent host, who was always helpful and kind."

4817072,43596425,2015-08-20,3290830,Mike,"Great location. There was a slight issue getting in, and there were no sheets on the bed or clean towels. I ended up doing laundry in the morning. Mandy was very apologetic and offered to make it right. 

Even with the small issue, I would definitely rent from them again. "
21580126,252916814,2018-04-12,183490440,Abby,"Super clean, awesomely specific instructions, and a wonderful spot to stay in during my trip to Denver. Thank you!"

33940833,544643235,2019-10-10,54533110,Mari,"One of the cleanest airbnbs I’ve ever been to. Right across from a small city park, too! Was perfect for a quick visit to the city."
22139867,477135629,2019-06-27,245598827,Sarah,"The apartment is clean and the hosts are responsive and pleasant. However, there was no wifi, the coffee maker was broken, there is no A/C in the bedroom and it gets quite hot (even with the door open), the bathroom sink doesn’t work very well, and there are many light switches that are not connected to anything. The shower will also change temperature unexpectedly. Our stay was not unpleasant, but it was not what we were expecting either."
24771533,512944523,2019-08-18,71021680,Brian,"immaculate place in a great neighborhood--eat at cuba cuba! you could, and i have, done a lot worse than this spot!"
18023988,283369941,2018-06-29,20001365,Kate,"I wish my friend and I had more time and clearer heads when we arrived. Our flight coming in to Denver was SO delayed and we landed at the time the concert we were supposed to be at started!! Ryan and Maia were very responsive to all of my distress messages. They are excellent with communication!

Everything you need to know about your stay is given in great detail. Check in and arrival were easy. The key pad at the front door was especially helpful for us being that our intended arrival ended up being several hours later. 

It was a quiet neighborhood and the house was very comfortable for us. We were supposed to be a party of five people, but only two of us made it in. It would have been perfect for five people. The house appeared to be well stocked with everything you could need. 

Sorry for the short review. Our time there was meant to be a day long with a few more people and I feel like all we ended up doing was quickly throwing our luggage in the house, going to a concert, doing a quick load of laundry, sleeping for a few hours, and leaving in the morning. It was an extremely quick stay, but the house was great. We would stay again for sure!"
21126734,365805909,2019-01-01,169915353,Debbie,Host is helpful and attentive——location is very good— attractive property
142683,5985350,2013-07-25,6689929,Edwin,"We had a very nice 2 night stay recently. Excellent location--lovely neighborhood, convenient to grocery shopping and restaurants and the park. Easy to get to downtown. AC works! Nancy is a wonderful host. With laundry and kitchen facilities, we felt at home and on vacation at the same time. Exactly what we were looking for. "
16857174,353820174,2018-11-29,155393822,Sean,Couldn’t have asked for a better location. Very comfortable and easy stay.
23308643,547683009,2019-10-15,64674927,Tanner,"This spot is perfectly tucked away in a busy neighborhood filled with great shops, restaurants, and bars. The place has a killer shower, fantastic natural light, and has great decor all around. Would definitely stay again."
34696373,523027073,2019-09-02,20132852,Victor,The hosts are extremely hospitable. It felt like staying with a close friend! We are glad to have experienced our first trip to Denver with Gwen and company!
19751569,202007796,2017-10-09,85007771,Joseph,"The Logan Refuge was an absolutely beautiful home that had everything anyone could ever need (full kitchen, coffee machine, washer/dryer, etc.). We will definitely revisit this airbnb next time we are in Denver."
18014902,318293543,2018-09-03,92672498,Jonah,"This place is essentially a basement turned into living quarters. It is a super cool little spot. It was clean, and actually pretty roomy for the space. They provide an A/C unit to help cool the place down. If you need a fan for air circulation, just ask. They had one on deck :)
Since this room is below the main house, you can hear people walking around above, but it isn't bad and sleeping was not an issue.
They do have a dog, but he is awesome. Super friendly and sweet. He just wants to be pet.

Michele and Brian are amazing hosts. Great communication, super nice, and accommodating.

I would definitely look to stay there again if I visited Denver.

Thank you Michele and Brian."
3685552,58159675,2016-01-01,37887319,Elizabeth,"Heather was very welcoming and responded  quickly to an e-mail or two asking for information I already had but couldn't find immediately.  The space is lovely with a bohemian charm perfect for Denver.  Heather has paid great attention to details -- wonderful sheets, nice towels, and a kitchen equipped with everything we needed.  Kiehl's shampoo in the shower -- WOW! And -- what can beat an outdoor space accessed through a window?   We appreciated the lovely flowers and wine we found when we arrived.  I will stay here again when in Denver. "
23006749,262044018,2018-05-07,93380176,Karla,We loved our 15-20 minute morning walks to restaurants and shopping. Great little space for a weekend getaway. Thank you Matthew!
19501629,431356392,2019-03-31,48343697,Jeremy,"Sarah's place is a good value and she provides everything you need for your stay. The apartment is in a renovated basement of one of a set of duplexes, so you may hear or see the neighbors. They are friendly and helpful. The bed and pillows are very comfy. It is easy to get to different parts of the city from here. A 15-20 minute walk to the Convention Center, 25 minute walk to the capital, a 20 minute walk to 16th street mall. The 16th street mall has free buses that go up and down it between Union Station and a station near the capital. There are plenty of scooters around also to help with transportation.  Overall a good place to stay if you want to stay in Downtown Denver for a reasonable price."
13972526,546536188,2019-10-13,143717713,Samantha,"Cozy home with a view of the mountains right outside. We booked our stay for a couple shows at Red Rocks and getting to/from was a breeze. The beds were comfy, kitchen had everything needed, and John and Karina were super responsive for any questions or concerns. Would stay again!"
15471561,167163810,2017-07-05,129330566,Stephanie,Amazing home with everything you could possibly need and street parking right out front of the house!!  Totally perfect for 7 of us in town for a family wedding.  We were all new to Denver and this was a pristine home that we all enjoyed.  Reed was very responsive to all our questions and we were able to navigate the area quickly.  He even brought my mom a regular coffee maker (even though he had a high end nespresso machine!) so she could have her regular morning coffee.  Great location to accessing downtown Denver and easy access to highways.  The Lo-Hi area was such a nice place to stay with a wonderful neighborhood vibe.  Great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance we didn't need to leave to have all we needed to enjoy the local hot spots!  Thanks Reed we will be back for sure and I'd recommend your home to anyone looking for a great place to stay close to downtown.
22513575,522901889,2019-09-02,97144524,Blake,"This house has a great location if you mind a little walking. It is close enough to everything one can want to do in Denver yet far enough away that you feel at home in a residential community. 

Great extras around the house and had the stay been longer that kitchen would have been home to a nicely cooked meal.

Very nice place and great location. I hope to return and stay here again!"
9009513,494144706,2019-07-23,15677640,Michelle,"Katie's place is very cute, clean and close to shops and cafes. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again when we are in Denver to visit our daughter and son-in-law."

The internet ran super slow and we were not able to stream Netflix or Apple TV as we were told. Very disappointing to sit in the quiet house due to this not working."

The room is on the small side, but very well-kept.  Bathroom was small but elegant.   Do realize that Mary's bedroom is right above this room.

Her Airbnb is just lovely, but would not work for four adults. Two adults and a child perhaps. Otherwise, it’s very clean and very comfortable. We would stay there again!"

The home is squeezed between 2 houses & looks small, but upon entering you are welcomed into an open feeling with a great floor plan & beautiful renovation job.    

The home has great vibes!! We enjoyed working & using modern updated kitchen & baths. The décor was thoughtfully done, and the exposed original brick walls are beautiful.  The room have appropriately sized & very comfortable furniture – great beds….  The entryway has room for an office area & living room with a great fireplace to warm your spirit.  The main level has beautiful hardwoods throughout, the dining area is loaded with great light and the TV room is cozy.  The upstairs 3 bedrooms are a comfortable size each sporting their own theme.  The large back yard is private & a great plus. Internet worked beautifully, even when all 4 of us were online. 

We very much enjoyed the location, close to the Zoo, botanical gardens, museums & downtown / shopping.  We enjoyed short walks to the Purple Door for morning coffee -  who’s shop owner was very friendly & welcoming.  We enjoy Colorado and our stay in Denver offered great convenience to many parks including one at the end of 30th Ave.  Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did.  Thank you Lynnette

They both played a huge part in my days/experience in Denver. As for the room I stayed in, it was awesome. I basically had my own apartment, with a bed, couch, TV, and everything else I could've ever wanted. Thank you Lisa & Dave. I had a great experience."

They were very helpful and gave us suggestions for tourist destinations. The location is really close to the highway that leads into downtown and the mountain trails, so there wasn’t any problem getting to places. The area was pretty quiet. The wifi signal was pretty strong. The bathroom was clean and organized. The bed and couch were comfy, it made those naps in between day activities and night outings feel amazing. With all that being said, the space made me and my friend feel safe and comfortable. It felt like another home."

We especially enjoyed the comfortable beds and use of the kitchen for cooking breakfast. The location was easily accessible to everything we wanted to do with our rental car. We also enjoyed walking to the local ice cream shop, took a long walk around the lake (with a stop at the lake playground, of course), and had delicious Hawaiian food on Sheridan at Ohana Grille. We had a minor snafu with the breaker tripping and were thankful for David and Cheryle’s quick responses and action. I recall reading some reviews about noise from above. Though we did hear some walking around and moderate noise from creaking hardwood floors above, it wasn’t late at night and it wasn’t bothersome at all. I would ABSOLUTELY stay here again."
25369287,333826416,2018-10-07,19967519,Jessica,"We loved our stay! The house was beautifully decorated and just the right mix of modern and antique. The location is stellar - it's in a very quiet neighborhood, but an easy walk from restaurants, breweries, and even a distillery.

What really made this trip was the hospitality - Julie had fantastic local tips and made us feel truly at home. David was very responsive and eager to help; you can tell he loves hosting! We'll definitely be staying here again!"

The place is exactly as described, cozy little place in a safe neighborhood. My little son and I walked to the children's museum, which has been on top of his todo list. 

I'd definitely book this place again on my next visit. "
7931953,504418206,2019-08-07,246855709,Philip,"We loved our stay at the LoHi cottage.  Pre-trip communication was precise.  Tonya was onsite to welcome us warmly as we rolled into Denver.   The neighborhood crib sheet on restaurants and bars was spot on. We parked the car for two days and explored on foot and Uber.  

The cottage is spacious, stylishly furnished and 100% SPOTLESS.   (Kimberly and Tonya enforce a strict no shoes in the house policy and it shows.)  It was smoking hot in Denver while we were there, and both window AC units are newer and performed well (without a lot of clanking).   Clean and cool are concerns of mine especially in older buildings.  In addition to the well articulated crib sheet, there was really good coffee and tea available for us to get our day started.   I really especially liked playing the 70s era Jensen hi-fi.  Somehow the flea market sourced scratchy Frank Sinatra vinyl was the perfect audio stream for the place.  

P.S.  We dined at Lola (Monday night - All Day Happy Hour) and Gallop Cafe for Breakfast.  Date night was Rioja at Larimer Sq.   They were all great with friendly, knowledgeable service and real good food."

I also caught Liz on my way out to dinner the first night.  She made sure that I had everything I needed and was comfortable.  She let me know to message her any time to adjust the AC.  Additionally she let me know to reach out for food suggestions.

20730936,273612220,2018-06-06,52609016,Ariel,"We had a wonderful stay at Julia’s place! Initially, we wanted to stay closer to downtown, but we realized once we got to Julia’s place in Curtis Park, that we were not only close to everything, but also in a very charming, local part of the city. The house was very beautifully decorated and unique which also made our stay feel special. Additionally, the location of the house made us feel like we were a part of the local scene of Denver and not just tourists. We would absolutely recommend this place to others."

1309159,13509887,2014-05-29,11166610,Megan,"This is a great place to live like locals in Denver! Joe answered all of my crazy questions, gave us great tips about the area, and was the consummate host. We were seeking an unfrilly base of operations for our urban exploring and this fit the bill perfectly. It was unseasonably warm one night but it wasn't anything the fan couldn't alleviate, and the mattress was extremely comfortable! The dedicated parking spot was a plus, but we didn't use our car very much... lots of great places within walking distance including Lowdown Brewery, a recommendation from Joe that turned out to be the best microbrewery we visited. Thanks Joe, we'd happily recommend you to our friends and hope your garden is successful this summer!  "

The space is beautifully remodeled with modern high end finishes. It was like we were staying at a 5 star hotel.  Fresh linens, towels, and even bathrobes were provided. My wife and I loved our stay. Five stars across the board and we hope to be back soon.  Thanks again!!!"

6355337,82064098,2016-06-26,28279612,Alfonzo,"Everything was beyond expectations. As my first Airbnb experience, I can say that staying at Darrel's place felt as if I had never left my home. He was very welcoming and made sure to provide us with privacy, yet he was only a text away to whatever we needed. He truly enjoys this business and it shows as the place was kept up perfectly. Overall, the trip felt very comfortable and I am very happy with my decision. Will definitely return again. "

7497461,526865880,2019-09-09,158855483,Ramsay,"Place is just as described. Extra  nice touches were the fan and coffee maker. It looks like there are a lot of good places to go for a beer and food, but we didn’t have a chance thanks to AAir cancelling our Saturday flight. Hostess let us change plans from 2 nights to one with no problem. Responded immediately to my communications. Very friendly."
27356668,497669235,2019-07-28,32229806,Amanda,"Awesome location, clean and quick responses. Really small so I wouldn't go with more than 2 people and don't bring too many groceries"

10494162,452730090,2019-05-13,128615194,Crystal,"First I would like to say this place is so cute! The proximity to the city is a great feature while staying here. Most of anything you would like to do downtown in the city is about 10-15 mins driving time. Around their Airbnb there are also plenty of things to walk to. We loved the Whitter Pub! It has easy access to the freeways so you can go explore Boulder, RM National Park, etc.  My husband and I would definitely stay here again.  One more thing, Wes and his wife are great hosts and we really appreciated the advice they gave us on things to do!"
1189999,163148029,2017-06-23,57800913,Andrea,"Mike's place is great! The location was perfect to get downtown, to interstates, and restaurants/shops. Mike was helpful in giving advice for the area.

18811589,412853111,2019-02-16,67661991,Prashant,"Marlene deserves to be a super host. My son and I were visiting Denver for two nights and found the check in to the check out experience warm, comfortable, thoughtful and friendly.  The cleanliness,  the music, the amenities were par excellence. We had to extend our check out by 90 minutes due to a logistics issue, however Marlene understood our situation and accommodated our request like a thoroughbred host. In case we visit Denver again, we will definitely check with Marlene first if she would have us over again :)."

Although we were only in town for a night for a concert, and our stay was short, her place was exactly what we needed for our visit.  I highly recommend that you book with Leanne for your trip to Denver!"

9471950,253497605,2018-04-14,4889017,Colin,"Lovely place. You'll be staying in the downstairs, sub-street level portion of a house. Hardly met Celia at all but Gretchen did a great job of welcoming me and making sure everything was taken care of. I really liked the location. It's residential but within a ten minute walk from several different bustling districts--great for walking out and getting to explore various neighborhoods. The unit itself is cozy and outfitted with basically everything you might need. The fridge came pre-stocked with some food and drinks which is a very nice touch when you're traveling and haven't had a chance to go shopping. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is nice as well. Highly recommend!"
18002228,156435861,2017-05-30,96236160,Junni,"Clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated 2-bedroom apartment. Beds in both bedrooms were comfortable. Great and central location, and close to many restaurants and cafes. Host was communicative. Check in and check out were smooth. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated having access to the washer and dryer in the basement. We definitely recommend this apartment to travelers visiting Denver. "

Specifically, we received our check in instructions much later than expected.  I thought we were to receive them around 11 am. We got them at 2:30 pm, after we'd left our homes and headed to the condo. 

The key fob didn't work when we arrived and no one responded to our calls or texts for help. Jim, the Concierge, finally offered to assist us. 

We couldn't control the temperature in the room with the thermostat and there were no instructions on how to adjust it. We had to leave the deck door open most of the night to cool off the room. 

None of these would've been major issues had someone been available to respond to our requests for assistance. It was very frustrating as we had a short window of time between our arrival and our dinner reservation."
16165056,263300457,2018-05-11,40541371,Erin,"Kelsey and Dan were such great hosts! They made their home feel like our home while we were visiting the area house hunting! Their dog Gryphon, a Bernese mountain dog, was the most gentle giant ever! Would definitely recommend staying here!"
15766497,132400483,2017-02-17,75280113,Myles,"This was a very cozy, quiet stay with all amenities promised. Jacob was very accommodating, addressed all concerns promptly, and was an overall excellent host. Be mindful of Five Points at certain times during the day if considering public transportation. That one block walk to the light rail and wait for the next train upon arrival can feel pretty unsafe. "
3686629,101365752,2016-09-12,29191899,Hayley,Easy as pie and a great location! Definitely worth staying here for your first visit to Denver

We liked that it was a close walk to downtown and lots of restaurants. There's a cute little outdoor patio where we could eat and talk and enjoy the weather.

25459427,543428226,2019-10-07,263412604,Sandra,"It's easy to feel at home right away! There's a refreshing energy that pulls you in when you arrive, and leaves a memorable impression when you leave. You know right away where everything is and there's no second guessing where things are or what to use, since there are labels and notes everywhere. Her home is incredibly tidy! 

Rondi herself is very kind and open when you meet her. She remained hospitable during our stay and made a point to offer suggestions before we left. The suggestions were always great! 

Not staying here is a missed opportunity!!"

Loved the master bedroom bed and the shower! Very updated! The downstairs bedrooms and bathroom was very well laid out.  Whole house was very clean. Would have liked having a tv at night to unwind.  Would recommend this house! Great communication with host!"
25477072,487127331,2019-07-13,21427466,Cassandra,"This house is beautiful and in a great location in Denver. LaMark is a wonderful host, very helpful and accommodating. I will say there is no AC in the house and our room was in the sun all day so it did get quite warm. We were there in a heat wave though so I doubt it's often an issue but one to be aware of if traveling in summer. Also the bathroom is down the hall from the bedroom, not connected to it. I had misunderstood that from the listing. We really enjoyed the backyard space and coffee in the Adirondacks each morning. Lovely space for a visit to Denver. Highly recommended."
6730800,89412054,2016-07-28,16714658,Rick,"Easy check in, everything we needed was there. Lots of bars and restaurants to walk to and a quick ride to get down town."

The decor was stylish and comfortable and we found the unit very clean.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was functional (shower had great water pressure).  Michelle and Brian are great hosts and include amenities such as coffee, tea, water, and snack bars.  The kitchen is equipped with a small refrigerator and a full stove along with a small table for two.  The location is excellent--it is in the uptown area which makes it very easy to walk to downtown and the 16th Streeet mall.  Around the corner on 17th street, there are many restaurants, coffee shops and an excellent market within easy walking distance.  We had a great stay and would not hesitate to visit this air bnb again."

The hosts were very accommodating and gracious. We passed them a couple of times and they made us feel very welcomed. 
The area was fantastic. Right off of South Broadway with tons of eating and shopping within walking distance. Our favorite was Nooch Vegan Market which was right at the end of the alley. One day Way Wong Vegan Food Truck was parked in front of the market which was a delicious surprise. 
Overall we were thrilled with our stay and have no complaints. One of the best AirBnB homes we have stayed in. Will definitely book here again."

We will definitely try to stay at her home whenever we come back to Denver!"

It's a very short drive to downtown Denver, which lies just to the east.  The neighborhood is great for strolling, and the house is only a few blocks away from Sloan Lake and its surrounding parks.

Clean and comfortable with all systems running smoothly &  central location giving you easy access to wherever you want to go in the city."
18596199,160364231,2017-06-13,131473045,Justin,"Our stay in Colorado, highlighted with travels up to Pike's Peak, hikes through the Garden of the Gods, and late-night city excursions, was made incredibly comfortable by the accommodations of this Airbnb.  There is nothing better than having a comfortable bed to sleep in (this bed is incredibly comfortable) - or an oversized sectional to recline on (this was also excellent) - after a long day of outdoor adventures.  Elizabeth and Josef could not have provided better lodging; the home was impeccably clean, outfitted with essentials - toiletries, snacks, fresh towels and linens - and expertly located for quick rides throughout Denver (it is even walking distance to a few nice spots, including the beautiful Botanic Gardens).  Communication was incredibly clear, and Elizabeth even accommodated to allow us to check-out an hour later than anticipated upon learning of a flight delay.  Overall, this stay far exceeded our expectations, and value for money, we could not imagine a better place to stay in Denver!"

As for the space - the pictures are really true to what you get, the home was beautiful and spacious while still feeling cozy, and everything was clean and easy to find. Selina was an incredible host - she was available for questions and made sure we had everything we needed when we checked in and out. She provided a great list of local recommendations and really did a great job making the space inviting. Highly recommend this Airbnb and would definitely stay here again!"

I would definitely recommend Courtney's home to others looking for a nice, easy place to stay. Thanks, Courtney!"
74125,30163686,2015-04-18,3668624,Alison,"Joe was extremely personable and quick to reply not only while booking his apartment, but throughout the stay as well. Keys were super easy to procure and I never had any issues throughout my stay (bar one minor toilet paper shortage.) Overall it was awesome to have the whole place to myself and the benefits of staying in an active apartment is that it is fully stocked with anything you could need. The downside of this was that it felt almost too lived it; as though Joe might come back through the door at any moment. TONS of random computers and junk lying around added to a cluttered feel, and definitely solidified my concern that there was no way this place had been cleaned in months. Cotton balls, coins, ear plugs, dust bunnies all scattered throughout the apartment. Towels and linens felt clean,  but worn. Definitely a casual, lived-in atmosphere. Wish it felt just a touch cleaner, but as far as communication goes, Joe was great."

36601078,566199313,2019-11-18,78713912,Alejandro,"Caitlin’s place was amazing. It is close to downtown and has plenty of nice resturants in the surrouding area. The size of the suite is quite impressive being that it's a basement. The suite was clean and had all the amenities we needed. We loved our stay there and would highly recommend this place to anyone. Our group had 5 people and we all had plenty of space. Caitlin was very nice in helping us with a problem we had (not related to her place) and gave us plenty of privacy. 
 Thank you so much Caitlin!"

14447199,326605225,2018-09-22,49557208,Adrian,"Lovely spot!  Its the last little house on a dead-end side road of 5 small, identical houses.  Lots of family photos and a sort of ""chic grandma"" decor.  I like the entry system where you type in a code-easy to use and no keys to keep track of.  The mini split (heating/cooling) kept the whole house a nice temperature.  A lot of mail did arrive for Ginny (the host/landlord), including packages.  Lovely flower beds out front- Ginny was going to stop by and water them but I volunteered since I miss my own garden.  Great stay overall."

18396744,365744223,2019-01-01,168553487,Cheyenne,"We loved this little charmer in Denver! It wasn’t perfect for what we were looking for. We were 7 guests in total. Although the neighborhood wasn’t the best, it was as expected in the downtown area. The inside however was great. Very comfortable and accommodating. The hosts were very responsive and even let us leave our luggage at their place after check out time. The house had a lot of personal belongings inside which was different than places we’ve stayed in the past, but we didn’t mind at all. Perfect location to access downtown. About a 5-6 minute Uber. Definitely consider booking!"

20587440,479331260,2019-06-30,63609188,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"Craig is a wonderful host!  My husband, our two teenage daughters, and I stayed for several days.  The location is central which worked out both for walking as there are   several restaurants, the State Capitol and the Margret Brown home near-by, and for driving.   Craig offers off street parking.  The rooms: 2 bedrooms, sitting area with a kitchenette, and bathroom are in the basement and are very comfortable.  I kept forgetting we were in a basement.  Craig has added several nice touches such as charging towers, snacks, and plenty of towels and washclothes.   The Pinball machines are an added bonus even if I still stink at them.  There is an outdoor sitting area in the back and also on the front porch.  As the Capital Hill area is quite diverse, sitting on the porch and people watching was a lot of fun.  The dogs are quite friendly and one even spent sometime with us in our sitting area, much to the delight of my daughters.   There is a staircase to get down to the unit."

His home is not too far from literally everything. Boulder, Colorado Springs, Idaho Springs, and Red Rocks are all within no more than 30ish min from his home (and Mount Evans is about an hour away from Idaho Springs)! Mark even left us a binder with all the information needed in regards to our stay such as the address and wifi info. He also left additional information about places to eat and breweries. There were also snacks left for us, which was a very sweet touch! And the cleanliness, was impeccable. I have nothing but great things to say about this stay! Thank you Mark! I would definitely stay time and time again!"

I found it very easy (and cheap!) to get an Uber into downtown, and very close to get anywhere I wanted to go.

If traveling to get something done it’s great if traveling for vacation and looking for a get away, fun restaurants and bars and a bit of a fancy rental I recommend something closer to downtown or closer to Little Man Ice Cream.  The renters are very accommodating! Just depends what you are looking for."

With multiple cars I was initially concerned about the parking as there is only one space behind the residence however we were able to find additional parking very close to the home.  I would definitely recommend this  home.  Home was very clean and beds were very comfortable.  Mercedes was an excellent greeter when we arrived. Joshua was always very responsive any time we had questions. We truly enjoyed our stay and would stay again!

18275427,177402773,2017-08-02,1571070,Mark,"Daniel is a terrific host that was so helpful to us. The home is very cozy with everything we needed. Convenient to downtown Denver and nearby restaurants also, an easy Uber ride to Coors field. We would definitely come back."
2119667,248547000,2018-03-31,38604910,Tiara,"The place overall was well represented and Kate made herself available for quick communication. My only complaint is the house insulation against noise. Anything going on outside can be heard very clearly inside the house. If you are not bothered by noise, it won't be an issue. But if you are, this could be problematic."
29860992,353162255,2018-11-26,146357581,Sourabh,An amazing condo with everything you need. Very well maintained.

The bed was incredibly comfortable and there were plenty of towels, as well as coffee and purified water. We enjoyed the proximity to Highlands Square and walking around the neighborhood. Kevin was very communicative and thoughtful as a host."

3487191,59638862,2016-01-13,22773182,Alexander,"Nathen provided AN AWESOME, fun experience for us. The privacy of the carriage house was perfect for us and was in a great location. Uber and Lyft were never more than 3 minutes away, and the neighborhood overall is very quiet and has a good character. Extra points for real nice touches such as the moisturizer (its REALLY dry in CO in the winter) and the coffee selections. Hot water was plentiful and hot, and the climate controls worked great. The TV and channel selection was nice. Memory foam bed is nice, and the leather sofa is awesome. Overall, this felt like a home away from home for us, and thats the best feeling a host can provide. We will book this again. If you're reading this review, just book it already! You will have a nice stay here."
20441430,355366341,2018-12-03,226809994,Katie,"Johns place is snug and cute, very personal and private. Everything was absolutely perfect for me and my boyfriend! He’s a very nice guy, respects privacy, and is very helpful. Highly recommended!"
29282321,454616608,2019-05-18,6308085,Florian,Megan and David’s place is perfect for a visit to Denver. We had only little time in the city but really enjoyed the location of the guesthouse. It is very stylish and was sparkling clean. Lots of nice restaurants close by and Megan and David replied very fast to all of our questions. Checking in was easy. Highly recommended!
14531625,466756585,2019-06-09,131380453,Jorge,"Great location, awesome home."
23769761,558157304,2019-11-02,252617525,Katie,"When we got there it was exactly what I was expecting! Cute, stylish, great location! But as we got in and looking around we noticed how cold it was inside. We went to thermostat and it would not heat up. We called the maintenance line and after about 3 hours of back n forth, we ended up going and buy space heaters. We couldnt find a new place such late notice and we couldn't get a refund to help us get something how prices go so high last minute. It was a nightmare. Thankfully the space heaters worked and we were out the next morning."
5229866,303170901,2018-08-06,82893853,Michael,"Fully stocked with amenities + appliances.  Very clean, comfortable! "

"
18501266,174387167,2017-07-25,108118799,Terry,"Great location; in a quiet neighbourhood. Walkable to amazing breweries and awesome restaurants. Uber rides are not that expensive as well. Being it 420 friendly, Channan did not sleep on that. He provided various pipes and bongs and also has an oil rig for any dabbers. There was a communal box of papers and some good weed upon arrival which we smoked a little then left some Girl Scout Cookies for the next guests to smoke too. His kombucha is off the roofs too. Overall, an amazing stay and will def come back soon. "
33254257,458925215,2019-05-26,175552956,Rae,"The place was clean, cozy, had a nice bed and easy safe parking. It’s walking distance to some nice restaurants but still feels private. I’d definitely stay here again."
20419783,406168722,2019-01-28,232997257,Jasmine,This was my first AirBnB experience and it was better than expected. The place is exactly like the photos. Check in was super smooth and easy. Communication was great. This place was located central to everything. Overall a great stay!

His place is very clean and furnished to a high standard and Rudy is a very cute and sweet natured dog. The bed is very comfortable, great AC for when you need it and easy on-street parking if you're driving. Highly recommended."

787456,7334553,2013-09-16,5241378,Robert & Amelia,"Pamela and Brad are above and beyond hosts!  We arrived to the beautiful house and lovely private room and bathroom to the tune of fresh water and fruit.  The location, outdoor space, and decor can't be beat, and waking up to the beautiful layout of tea, coffee, granolas, fruit, and porridge was just awesome.  We were unprepared for hiking but upon expressing an interest to go, Pamela took time to sit down with maps to share her ample knowledge of the mountains (especially helpful as at it was immediately after their big floods), and ended up generously outfitting us with the supplies we lacked.  To say the least, I don't know how it can get better than these two and the experience they offer.  I recommend them to anyone who deserves them as a host.    :)"
2216969,109260918,2016-10-20,69586754,Travis,Jeff and Patty were excellent hosts. The snacks available upon arrival were much appreciated after a long day of travel. The studio was set up beautifully and they had everything we could possibly need. It felt like we had a home away from home in the city of Denver.

Ended up being one of the best places I’ve stayed. The process went seamlessly and the host is so hospitable and welcoming. The view from the roof top is stunning and an a crazy way to see Denver! I would recommend to anyone, thinking about staying the experience was worth it."
20722746,240890864,2018-03-06,168996175,Gab,"Would deff recommended and stay again when we go back. Was very close to a lot of dispensary, restaurants, and lakes. Place was very clean and close to transportation felt like home in a way."

22506969,231144526,2018-01-30,6563980,Daniel,"This was a cute, lovely spot in an excellent location. It's walking/biking distance to a number of places, and centrally located to so much that Denver has to offer. My wife and my parents were all pleased with the amenities and how cute the place looked. Shanna and Chris were responsive via text message and we'd definitely stay here again!"

Next time I visit Denver I will book through Annette.

32085377,503884960,2019-08-06,66188404,Joe And Faith,"Just stopped for the night on our way to the east coast. Private entrance, description and communication was great! The welcome book was full of great information that we would have loved to explored if we had more time. :)"

The location was great, with restaurants, breweries, and other fun things to do within walking distance. Also, the owners were very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Overall, a great place to stay!"
5347637,28102469,2015-03-17,15188860,Jessy,"Greg's place was convenient, clean, and much more that expected. This Was our First air bnb experience and Greg really knocked it out of the park. If your looking for a place in Denver that's a great neighborhood, very underpriced, and comfortable this is it. We would love to stay with Greg again at some point."
13657498,232640162,2018-02-05,74587311,James,"In the past I've stayed at local hotels when in the area working (installing custom kitchens and cabinetry) but this time I thought I'd try an Airbnb. This was my first Airbnb stay and Jeff's home exceeded my expectations in every way. I won't hesitate to book again. The room is huge and offers everything necessary and the bath is WoW !  Beautiful home ! Jeff prepares a great breakfast too, just to cap off your stay."
756594,23702860,2014-12-08,42437,Barbara,"To be greeted every morning with homemade scones and jam? Need I say more? Okay, I will: a simple and immaculate apartment. If I'd known the frig would be stocked with milk,butter, juice, etc, or that there would be a mini set-up of tea, coffee, silverware,etc, or that the bathroom would contain the necessaries (shampoo, etc), I would not have dragged this stuff from NYC. Tons of towels, a laundry room right outside the door, a guestbook to explain Denver…  We were in Denver to visit family so Ling and Chris' apartment served us admirably, as well as central to metro Denver. There was onsite parking so no worry about moving the car, or parking at night, which we did all the nights, although the neighborhood was fine. And their rate (I know you are all interested) was absolutely fair. Many thanks, Ling and Chris, for making a rental so easy."
19501629,434875590,2019-04-08,244151861,Taylor,The place was great and the experience was seamless and easy! We loved it!

9515084,83029936,2016-06-30,44317516,Teresa,"A convenient base for anyone who need to be near the Convention Centre. It was a spacious apartment for one, the wifi was excellent and it was great to have access to HBO and Netflix to unwind to at the end of the day. Katie was also extremely flexible in allowing me to check out late, allowing me to explore some of the beautiful mountain parks around Denver in the morning."

The location was AMAZING, so close to downtown RiNo. The park is right across the street so we spent a good amount of time laying in the sun. The bed was comfortable and the closets have huge mirrors on the exteriors which we loved when trying on our outfits to hit the town. Would definitely stay at Zoe's place again."

I told Preston that I would write this and imagine he didn't really expect me to do so, but it is sincerely meant. This is a perfect place to stay: extremely friendly,good humoured, helpful hosts, excellent location near first-rate restaurants, quiet neighbourhood, easy to get downtown, attractively furnished, good shower and bed – and an invisible barkless labrador (actually did see twice, so know exists)! What more could you want?"

You can't beat the location - easy walking distance from restaurants, shops, cafes, and just a short run down to the trail around Sloan's Lake. To top it off, Cory and Gracie are fantastic hosts. I'm super pleased to have met them and am proud to live in this great city with them around."

stayed anywhere else.  Mary was a truly hospitable host. Clean, comfortable, beautiful, private, with any amenity you could think of.  Extra special touches were provided- Mary’s homemade pumpkin bread and daily morning coffee!  Would highly recommend!!!!"
3412478,143190338,2017-04-10,14845335,Pamela,Brandy was an incredible host! She communicated very effectively and was always available if we needed anything.

We loved taking day trips to the mountain towns and exploring all that downtown Denver and the neighborhoods surrounding it had to offer. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. The view from the rooftop was amazing- quite a few stairs to get up there, but worth it! We spent a lot of time up there. There was some construction next door, but Jennifer warned me so we brought a noise machine. Overall, great spot- would definitely recommend!"

The only complaint was we were not made aware of the construction surrounding the area which was a bit noisy at times. David was quick with responses and helpful. There was a lot of inspections during our stay but he did give us a starbucks gift card for the inconvenience.

15831072,232867133,2018-02-06,9308517,Christina,"Pictures truly do not do this place justice. If you have any hesitation... just do it. It’s a lovely spacious studio in an incredible location with thoughtful amenities and touches. Perfect for a couple but could hold up to 4... might be tight though. Plenty of street parking, we parked basically in front of their house every night."

The location was awesome and it was so nice to have a place to park and not have to find street parking all the time. The convenience store right down the street was certainly a godsend. And the dogs, Zeke, Tobey and Mico, are little angels!! They bark a bit but they love cuddles and will hang out with you. I would definitely stay here again :)"

I just needed a place to sleep, and the room was very adequate, spacious and warm. Denver had its surprise October snow storm and Cynthia made sure I was comfortable. Another guest stayed in the house, but she was very quiet, hardly noticed she was there.
There is a shared bathroom, but my room had its own sink, which was nice. Very close to Cheesman Park. I had two peaceful nights, so the room suited me just perfect.
Communication with Cynthia was smooth."

I'd recommend this place for the location, and outdoor amenities. Cleaning needs to improve but overall nothing we couldn't handle. Lia was more than responsive, and their turn around to replace/repair things was impressive.

Thanks "

During our visit, my wife and I used this apartment as a place to hang out, a place to work, and a starting point for road trips to the mountains -- it was perfect for all of those. Tim was a communicative and hospitable host and we would definitely recommend his apartment!"
9201317,134868328,2017-03-01,117574293,Andres,Allison was a awesome host. The room was nice and clean. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were to. The house is clean and nicely decorated. If you are in Denver and stay at Allison's it's worth it.

24711150,424425630,2019-03-16,174676643,Megan,"This place is aesthetically adorable and homey - very cozy with kind, hospitable touches (bottle of wine). My only critiques would be that (1) the bed is very small and kind of uncomfortable, and the small balcony door upstairs isn’t sealed fully so it lets in a draft. Overall we enjoyed our brief stay here. My husband is over 6 feet tall though, so be forewarned that the bathroom is more conducive to more petite people. However, I loved the soaker tub - it is plenty spacious - and the kind touch of organic toiletries! This place is adorable and the hospitality it evident. Just keep in mind that it’s an older home, so it has some antique quirks!"
15022946,514761139,2019-08-21,283449669,Jenny,Mark and Dan are amazing! They really go above and beyond for you. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Denver!!

Everything was spectacular, from cleanliness, practicality, and even aesthetics. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved her home, and can not wait to visit again."
21151336,239670898,2018-03-02,10800619,Kimberly,"Hanna's place was probably the cleanest Airbnb that I've stayed at.  The space is way bigger than any one-bedroom hotel room, and it's way nicer!  We needed a place to stay for one night before flying home and picked Hanna's based on price.  We walked to Union Station, which was probably about 2 miles, but took an uber back as we didn't want to walk that distance at night.  Her kitchen even came equipped with fine china!  When booking, SAVE the email that gives you your lock-code to get in.  I had to re-request this information from Hanna since I had completely forgotten about it; luckily, she provided it to me within minutes of asking.  Her place was just what we needed to catch up on some well needed sleep after skiing all week and I'd love to stay there again."

27757260,368298429,2019-01-06,63241707,Stephanie,"Carly’s photos dont do the place justice! Killer views and location and its right above a grocery store which came in super clutch. She also had a bunch of things we forgot about which was great bc we didnt have to go buy them! And we really couldnt get enough of the fireplace Carly replied to all of our questions within minutes- her place really felt like home, I was so sad to leave! Highly recommend this place and Carly!!"

The place looks exactly like the pictures, it’s in a GREAT location with access to anything downtown, and the check-in was easy! The only complaint is that you can hear EVERYTHING that the upstairs apartment does. The guests were up at weird hours and we definitely woke up because of it. Other than that, it’s a great and affordable stay in Denver!!"

18227184,151415121,2017-05-12,30490990,Leah,"Matthew and Patrick are amazing, kind, and super responsive / informative which is helpful when you're trying to get around a new city. Their place was a nicely designed central location for checking out the various neighborhoods of Denver, most of which I did by foot. There was a bit of construction noise next door but it doesn't start too early luckily... And there is a roof deck that I sadly didn't get to use but had amazing views of the city, make some time for lounging!  "
16406440,463008591,2019-06-02,49485541,Emily,This place was perfect for the relaxed bachelorette party we had planned. We had everything needed and a gorgeous outdoor space to hang out in. We also loved their dog Sport who would come out and visit us from time to time.
15807058,296350288,2018-07-25,69301063,Beacon,Sweet place.  Easy to get to and from downtown with bus.  Cute restaurants nearby.  Amanda responds quickly and honestly.  Would definitely stay again.  
12068403,192636320,2017-09-10,20728849,Raquel,"I enjoyed my stay at Jessica's, the private courtyard was the highlight! Tidy and well stocked. Location is great when it comes to being close to good food. But the flat is located next door to a homeless shelter and area can be a little sketchy at night"
19503543,425161231,2019-03-17,92628006,Jessica,"Kinga’s place was amazing. Super stylish, and a great place for friends from all over the country to come together. Kinga was very quick to respond to my messages, and super accommodating. A great find!"
13081152,477668833,2019-06-28,85621382,Clara,"Mitchell was an awesome host. Super friendly and welcome. Bedroom was super clean and has a nice size, you can walk to the state capitol in about 20 minutes, which also is a plus. We only found the bathroom/ kitchen pretty dirty."
4638352,35295650,2015-06-17,30224468,Sheryl,"Portia and Tracy were both extremely welcoming and responsive to my last minute anxiety about arrival plans. The basement apartment was just as described, cozy and pleasant. Just what we needed as a get away while visiting relatives. Allowed us to have a slow start to the morning, and a hideout away from relatives in the evening for alone time and late night snack. The family upstairs were either very quiet or there is great sound insulation, either way the apartment was quiet. The neighborhood is quite. The apartment is only a few blocks from lots of great cafes, restaurants and bars on Tennyson. The area is great, we've been visiting the area for several years, and really enjoy it. An extra plus this year of not staying with relatives. We would love to return to the cozy basement apartment again."
23786376,412913383,2019-02-16,46408281,Shaunette,"Very cozy. Felt like home away from home! Lots of space and privacy if traveling with a group. 5 minute drive to Downtown, Banks...Shops etc. We felt very safe in this residential neighborhood."

20998214,207694024,2017-10-29,23229511,Nigel,"Great space in an easy to get to building. The hosts were great to communicate with and responded very promptly to queries. The neighbourhood is definitely underrated in Denver and there's a lot to do in close proximity. 

The laundry is in the basement, not in the unit. Hosts were kind enough to bring laundry detergent and sheets the next day (I'm assuming this will be kept in the unit for future use). Only amenity I would have liked is a hair dryer but definitely something I could live without. Really bustling neighbourhood and buses are easy to figure out. The internet in the unit is shared within the whole building and can be unreliable at times. The baking tray was too big for the oven. All of these things were really small things in the grand scheme of things. The hosts more than made up for it in a variety of ways. Will be staying here again when I return to Denver!"
3760606,460976385,2019-05-30,41971901,Seth,"I booked Kodie’s place the morning I was supposed to get there! And she was so accommodating. Let me check in early and everything! The place is beautiful, and the outdoor space is stunning! Would definitely recommend everyone to stay here! LOVED IT!"
23335521,271190275,2018-05-31,166471370,Ben,"Laura's spot is the PERFECT place for an extended stay in Denver! An absolutely great location within walking distance to a gym, groceries and tons of good restaurants, plus only a 15-20 minute drive away from virtually anything you'd want to do in Denver. The space itself has all the amenities you could ask for (the kitchenette is fantastic!) with complete privacy should you want it. Laura herself is a fantastic hostess and very quick with responses, answers and fixes to any problems you may have."

It’s a quick uber to downtown. 
Area seemed friendly, no issues. 
It says only one bathroom but there is one in the common are if you’re in a pinch."

21726072,405187276,2019-01-26,12134472,Christine,Joe's place is a cozy comfortable row house that is in a great location (quiet too) for exploring the RiNO neighborhood on foot.  Larimer Square and the rest of downtown Denver is walkable or a short Uber ride away.  Joe provided recommendations on dining and other activities that were very helpful.  The rail stop is a short distance away so you could actually ride the train from the airport and never need a car.  We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend to others!
1792152,96187159,2016-08-22,44468509,Lawrence,"We had a delightful stay at Rita's house.  It is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood-we were able to park our car in front of the house and enjoyed the tranquil setting of Congress Park. The room was charming-full of good books to read, travel guides and we enjoyed visiting with the warm and friendly dogs. Rita is a terrific host-had great suggestions for things to in Denver and beyond. She made fresh coffee in the morning, and was gracious and accomodating in sharing her lovely house, which is exactly as it is described in the description. We would certainly stay again on a return trip to Denver. Thanks Rita!"

The fitness center is also spacious and it appears to have a nice outdoor area (just didn't use). Todd and his partner are very responsive to questions and needs, and if my business travels bring me back to Colorado, I would definitely stay here. It's also about 50% less+ than the nearby hotels."

The space is very cute and clean, and garden is lovely. I felt like I was staying in Mrs. Madrigal's community from Tales of the City! The bed was VERY comfortable, and we slept like babies.

12990793,287098081,2018-07-07,55334104,John,"We loved staying at Pat’s! A lot of history and original work in this beautifully renovated home.
The location was great, super close to everything you could want to do in Denver with a pretty easy parking situation. 
Pat was an awesome host, and even was nice enough to walk us thru some of the unique history of the property. Would love to stay here again on the next visit!"
2441525,190995780,2017-09-05,34174539,Christine,"Juan's place was comfortable, conveniently located in the Highlands neighborhood in Denver, and provided all of the necessities you would expect. This is a very walkable, safe neighborhood.  We had a rental car and parking right out front was never a problem.  We loved sitting on the front porch in the mornings with coffee and again in the evening sipping a glass of wine!"
10494162,338884242,2018-10-20,58871910,Rafael,"This backyard guest house is charmingly decorated and spotlessly clean. The neighborhood is very pleasant with tree lined streets of 100+ year old homes. Wes was super responsive and made this an outstanding stay. 

When I come back to Denver this will be my first choice for a place to stay."

She was very available on the few occasions I needed her but I had plenty of privacy during my stay. The room was absolutely lovely, with every bit of the space arranged efficiently and set up to welcome guests with thorough labeling (like for the Wi-Fi password), helpful information, toiletry samples, and all kinds of wonderful little things. The location was great, close to bus routes, a lovely trail, and the gorgeous DU campus and just a short walk from restaurants and stores. Barbara and her family are exceptionally friendly, and I felt right at home during my stay with them."
9842499,443798193,2019-04-26,162615894,Mike,Gina makes you feel at home from the moment you walk through her doors.

Can’t wait to come back and visit
15807599,445132497,2019-04-28,101251988,Gabby,"House was beautiful and clean. Julie was so responsive even to my craziest questions. The one call out is that there was little flexibility with check in and check out due to the high demand of the house. They need to clean after people leave, which requires abiding by standard 4p check in and 11a check out. Couldn’t ask for more from them though. Thank you so much, Julie!!"

22928612,521277676,2019-08-31,148253272,Alec,"Tim's place is fantastic— my partner and I found we enjoyed hanging out in it more than we did walking around the city. Of course, the star of the show, Larry the dog, really added to the whole experience— but Tims knowledge on Denver, his warmth, and his excellent design skills (he designed the house himself!) made for an unforgettable stay. Would highly recommend!"

Would absolutely recommend! "

Check in was easy, and even though I arrived on a late flight, he made sure to be up and available to greet me and let me in.  The room was very private, with it's own entry, so I could come and go very easily as I pleased.  The location was convenient and easy for my purposes.  I would stay here again."

The neighborhood great, walking distance to many new and exciting small businesses.  It was easy to walk to these places, a little longer walk to downtown, but doable.  "

The unit is walkable to many locations. The unit was cozy, clean, and perfect for one or two. There were many outstanding amenities such as a keurig coffee maker. The hosts are very responsive and attended to all of my needs. Though I was unable to bring my kitty, this place is highly pet friendly! I loved this experience very much and would stay here again."

30979335,459044583,2019-05-26,5346067,Julie,"WOW!  Honestly, one of my best Airbnb experiences.  Perfect location, cool space, great host and very clean!  The condo is located right in the middle of it all- we all were able to arrive and depart at different times so easily with the light rail almost at the front door.  Very convenient to explore Denver.  We walked to Coors Field for a Rockies game, rented scooters and went exploring on the bike trail, walked to many great restaurants, used the Peloton bikes in the gym and had happy hour on the roof top deck. The actual condo felt like new- the bedding and towels were lovely.  It was also super nice that the owner had the basics available for us- no need to run to Whole Foods (across the street) for items like clothes detergent, condiments, trash bags, shampoo and more!  We will definitely stay here again to stay for our next Denver trip.   A+++ overall!"

36079695,547240597,2019-10-14,12669619,Neva,This is a fantastic place to stay in Denver.  It is walking distance from so many great restaurants and breweries in Denver and a very quick drive to some beautiful hikes.  The beds were super comfortable and we enjoyed our time hanging out inside the apartment as much as our time exploring Denver.  Highly recommend!

The host was professional, easy to reach, and highly responsive. The space was beautiful with a great view of downtown Denver and all the amenities we needed.

LoHo is so much better and the things to do around his place were great. Everything’s in walking distance, even to the city. You won’t regret it!"
9433028,78903731,2016-06-10,9829041,Becca,"This listing was good for a quick overnighter in the heart of Downtown Denver, but I'm not sure I would stay here for a longer time period if you're planning on sleep.
Pluses: Super close to Downtown Denver, comfy bed, friendly hosts. 
Minuses: Sheets and pillowcases had weird stains on them -probably from bleach? You're in the basement and can definitely hear the people and puppies above you nice and early in the morning. Couch was missing back cushions. "

The space is AWESOME and has everything you’d need and is in a great location. The only issue we had is with 14 people and 3 bathrooms we had some plumbing issues, but the host was very helpful. I’d stay here again!"
25262577,433041613,2019-04-05,239649060,Nick,This house was perfect for our family with 3 small children during our week long stay in Denver. We especially appreciated having access to the garage with washer & dryer.

The apartment is stylishly furnished, super clean with everything you need for a great stay. We'd return in a heartbeat.
The area is nice too; lovely coffee shops, cool diner (Jellys) and a short walk to the Capitol building.
Parking is controlled in the area, but this apartment comes with private parking at the rear with easy access which is a big plus.
Finally Christina is a great host: super friendly, flexible, responsive and full of recommendations."

The rooftop deck was large and has an amazing view of both downtown and the Rocky Mountains.

We walked through the stadium and across the bridge Along the river one day and then the other direction the next day! Great mileage! The REI flagship store is really amazing and they open early.  We loved the Briar Brewing that is just around the corner.  Easy access to the highway...red rocks was about 45 minutes away, pikes peak about 2 hours.

18626757,289155259,2018-07-11,124313523,Kenny,"Shelly’s apartment is absolute heaven. I spent a month in Denver for work and waking up every morning to the sun and mountains and coming home at night to a beautiful view of the city was everything I could have wanted. The space was even larger than the pictures made it look! The amenities were fabulous. Although the gym in the building is really great, with a gorgeous park right next door and the Cherry Creek Trail a two minute walk away, I ended up going outside for my daily run! Shelly could not have been more helpful and has one of the faster response times I’ve experienced from AirBnB hosts. Just an absolute joy. I sincerely hope that her apartment is available next time I end up in Denver!"
13657498,444308079,2019-04-27,29280724,Christina,I know why this space is often booked! It is very spacious and very clean with a generous bathroom. It’s a beautiful place and very close to DU. Jeff is very hospitable and is a very good cook.

I was already in Denver and needed to last min secure a place for 3 nights and Banks was right on it with providing a place within hours. Stated I could drop off bags early if needed and communicated clearly that it is a non-smoking house which is exactly what I was looking for. Check-in was smooth and his roommates Ryan + Jory were there to make sure the stay was going well. All extremely nice. This was my base to go everywhere I needed and knew I would be coming home to a restful night's sleep. Travelling alone I do note that this seemed like a safe neighborhood, people were friendly as I walked around and it was about $5 Lyft to go to Dwntn. Room was designed nicely + all very clean. Banks was just a text away if you had any questions.  Would stay again on my next trip to Denver! Thanks guys!"

14759489,122453567,2016-12-23,51854414,Arezu,"Darren's place is wonderful! My boyfriend and I stayed in Denver for the week and booked the basement suite. It's located in Five Points, so it's easy to get around and everything is pretty close. The suite itself was awesome! Modern and minimalistic; the bedroom was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the living area is cozy and was perfect for winding down in the evenings. The suite is secluded, so it's pretty ideal for privacy. However, if you're planning on using the top deck for any reason, you'll have to walk up the main stairs in the house and through the middle-level tenant's living area. We were lucky enough to have stayed with a really laid back fellow Airbnb-er, so everything went smoothly!  I highly recommend Darren's place if you're planning on taking a trip to Denver! 
We will definitely be coming back!  "
34017701,459790762,2019-05-27,127323,Ani,"The place is very comfortable with great access to the highlands neighborhood. The house is within 10-15 min drive of RiNo, LoDo, etc too! I would recommend the place to anyone!"

Tony and Carissa have a really cool place in a nice, artsy, quiet neighborhood. Lots of good restaurants around, close to public transportation but in a residential area. The place is amazingly clean, solo (unshared) bathroom which is very nice with shower, deck with a nice view, comfy bed, good-sized closet w hangers, ironing board, nice posters. Small kitchenette w microwave, sink, keurig coffee machine with refillable pods (bring coffee as I did), and a small refrigerator. Really nice touch of having some beer in the fridge—so nice after a long day traveling. Internet was good; didn’t use the TV in the room or their record player with a nice supply of classic albums—Janis, The Beatles, etc. . They’re both very friendly and have a very pretty Bengal cat (I’m slightly sensitive to cats and she didn’t bother me at all & is hypo-allergenic). I didn’t have a car, but street parking is free though sometimes crowded. I’d definitely stay there again—this place is a bargain (& very nice). Thanks Tony & Carissa!"

It is in a very convenient area and you can walk to several restaurants and bars from the loft. The loft was decorated so cute and had everything we needed in it. I only stayed 2 nights but we made the most out of it and this little loft made my experience in Denver a good one!

The cozy house is brand new and very nicely appointed, with its own separate entrance.  The neighborhood felt very safe, a few bars/restaurants within walking distance, walking distance to City Park and a short drive to downtown and other Denver neighborhoods.  Jenny and Brad were wonderful hosts; they were very responsive, and had thought of every detail to make us feel welcome.  I highly recommend this house and will definitely stay here again when we are in Denver.  Thanks, Jenny and Brad!  "

Everything was absolutely clean, the sofa and the beds were cozy, the bathroom and the kitchen were well equipped.

16313398,138625434,2017-03-20,8132517,Angela,"There were some issues with checkin but once I got in I wasn't disappointed. The townhouse is nicely decorated and lots of space to stretch out in. I personally couldn't park my SUV rental in the garage. It wouldn't fit with the all the boxes but there was street parking nearby. If given more time the host would probably be better prepared for guests but..
The bed, couch and shower were all comfortable enough. The second bedroom was not made up for second guest"

Le ménage avait été fait de manière impeccable, j'ai vécu une très bonne expérience. En revanche, en ce qui concerne le quartier il faut être assez méfiant, des individus peu recommandables peuvent s'y promener, je recommande de prendre un taxi ou similaire pour se rendre au centre ville ou rentrer la nuit."
23005566,262656171,2018-05-09,112022779,Emily,"John's place is very stylish, clean, and comfortable. It's in a great part of town that feels safe and many restaurants and bars within reasonable walking distance. John made himself available via text and had very quick responses! Just be cognizant of the check out time- I've never had one as early as 9am before. When I realized how early it was (totally my fault for not paying attention during booking), it changed our last day plans a bit and we had to take a nap in the park before leaving Denver since we had gone out the night before! Loved this cute place though!!"

10343072,531051555,2019-09-16,177259974,Kyle,"Great location. Perfect for two people, but it can get a little tight if you need to use the pull-out sofa. Overall, a great place to stay."
5956309,198233931,2017-09-28,25704617,LynnAGirl,"Communication was TOP NOTCH!  Alex is accommodating, friendly and flexible.  This is a great value location with manageable walking distances to public transportation options.  I didn't need more than a place to quickly shower, keep my stuff, and sleep while I explored Denver for s couple days.  This was perfect for my needs."
98008,65399350,2016-03-13,2907047,Matt,"Thanks to Jim for his generous hospitality and great conversations! The house is in a great location, and beautiful inside and out. It's easy and safe to walk to everything you'd want in Denver. I felt totally at home and would love to return. "

32092954,551987253,2019-10-20,108837938,Agustin,"Neighbourhood is very nice, we could relax in our stay. House is big, we were a group of 6 and all could have their privacy."
22056178,362127897,2018-12-25,71825011,Cees,Lisa made our stay great. There was never anytime that I felt bothered by anyone else but always felt like if I needed something or if something was wrong I could call or message and there would be someone there to help me quickly. The space has a spacious layout and the bathroom took the cake for me. The shower is were I wind down and let stress roll off of me and the wide rain shower head and very open shower made it feel so relaxing.
19435120,195774547,2017-09-20,141531980,Benjamin,The house had everything we needed! It was a great place to spend a night or a whole week. David and Cathy were awesome even going as far as to introduce themselves while we waited for an Uber out front. Absolutely would and will stay there again next time we're in Denver.
15746851,147601995,2017-04-27,50615143,Taras,"This house is beautiful and located in a lovely neighborhood near a park, the zoo, and the natural sciences museum. Rob and Catherine are great hosts and are very flexible."
3487191,361865403,2018-12-24,198509477,Jordan,It was our first time staying at an Air BNB AND we booked it literally the day before but they did an AMAZING job and the photos on the listing didn't do the place justice! We felt right at home and absolutely loved the little touches they have around the house and how quick to respond Nathen & Alicia were+they gave us a lot of good tips for around the neighborhood. Also as someone who likes to hoop and have cool artistic backdrops theres a really cool mural near their house which is perfect for hooping videos :) We would stay again
36646004,492733155,2019-07-21,272285205,Jace,"Great place for a one night stay, we had a small group of 5 and it worked out perfectly!"

26671491,506522656,2019-08-10,29894186,Amanda,We love Lunden’s place. This was our second stay and we will definitely come back again. The park hill area is so quiet and close to everything. The room and bathroom have everything we needed and are clean and comfortable. Lunden is a wonderful host and makes everything easy.

6333040,54572756,2015-11-22,12587422,Lea,"From start to finish, this was a dream vacation. Mick was extra gracious and the attention to detail was amazing. We felt right at home and every detail was on point. It's truly an exceptional experience when you realize that everything you need is already there and you can focus on exploring and relaxing into a new environment. The house manual and personal check-in were fantastic. The space itself is a dream. The location in Five Points and Rino adjacent, the hot tub, the kitchen, the bikes, the snacks and beverages...Mick has set the new bar for my AirBnb experiences. I'll be back soon!!! "
38158928,535568570,2019-09-24,260856707,Emily,"Staying at Tarynn's place was absolutely perfect for my family.  The kitchen has everything you could possibly imagine (spices, appliances, teas, pots and pans, literally everything!) and the living space is beautifully decorated and cozy.  They have an outdoor haven in their backyard for those who like to lounge, read, and drink up the lovely Denver weather. 
 The house is conveniently located to most attractions and Tarynn and Corey were so helpful in offering great recommendations for dinner, yoga, and fun adventures. Their communication, kindness, and hospitality is off-the-charts. We would definitely stay here again!"
32317445,508395345,2019-08-12,185278760,Marilyn,This is a very pleasant bungalow on a quiet street. Well supplied kitchen. Beds were very comfortable. We would stay here again!
2232930,177085976,2017-08-01,14902391,Kimberly,"Megan's house is cute, clean, and in an excellent part of Denver. However, I do not think it is accurate to describe as ""family friendly"" as the house is very full of decorative items, many of which are breakable. I would be worried about having young children stay here. The house is very full of Megan's belongings in general, which is mentioned in a prior review, but it made it difficult to figure out what space/belongings were intended for us (i.e., towels). Communication could also have been improved- my mother was listed as a guest on the reservation and reached out to Megan through airbnb, but she did not reply. She was responsive to me as reservation holder, however."
18811589,417286364,2019-02-26,15930187,Ruth,"This artist studio was my home away from home for a week. Marlene certainly made it as comfortable for me as possible. The walls were adorned with Marlene‘s artwork that covered many genres. Nostalgic notary phone on the end table and a record player. I haven’t played record since the 80s. Forgot how much it was to enjoy the albums. I played about everyone. My first was a Tom Jones album and the second song was “A Taste of Honey “how fitting since I’m a beekeeper. This was one of many precious moments. I mistakenly thought  there was a kitchen so I can make my eggs and toast in the morning. But to accommodate me I was surprised to find a brand new electric skillet and a toaster when I return to my studio. That made my day! Of all the Airbnb‘s I’ve stayed, the bed was by far the most comfortable with lovely sheets and comforter. For a solo traveler, Marlenes home was a deal. I felt safe – beautiful views – and a short distance to Tennyson Street where one of the best some of the rest restaurants and pubs can be found It’s not always about the space, it’s a love the hosts put into it that shines through. Will miss my studio"
18177763,411225528,2019-02-11,80098440,Christian,"Excellent BnB, great location. Hosts were very helpful. The house was exactly as advertised."
1035821,32808590,2015-05-22,21249060,Fernanda,"Big house and appropriate for 8 people. Walking distance from the convention center, or even closer be the trail. Clean house, big bedrooms, comfortable beds, silent and easygoing neighborhood, good coffeeshop closeby. Perfect Wi-Fi and warming devices. Awesome stay in Denver."
8566977,58417584,2016-01-02,15141286,Emily,"We had a great time staying at Corie's place in Denver -- it's adorable! We felt a little bad coming in late in the evening because the stairs are so creaky, but they didn't say anything so I hope it wasn't a problem. The floor of the apartment is a little squeaky too if you're a light sleeper, but it didn't bother us at all. Great light in the place, and a fun little TV setup for watching some New Years Eve football too!

We didn't meet our hosts, but Corie was nice enough to message me when our place was ready a couple hours early and they left us plenty of dishes, some water bottles, and a bottle of wine. We'd be happy to visit again!
"
27335756,468543463,2019-06-12,16998703,Lynn,"Great place to stay! You can’t beat the location, walking distance to almost everything. Janet was always just a call or text away if we needed anything. Definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking for a great walkable place in Denver."
9201317,63423290,2016-02-22,23953529,Monica,"Allison's place was great! It was quiet, warm and welcoming. She was very responsive, helpful and friendly. We spent 2 nights with her and I would highly recommend her space to everyone."

All the pictures are accurate, and the place is very well kept. 

I would suggest Patricia's place to anyone."

12068403,258769126,2018-04-29,21823949,Tela,This is a great space! Everything is clean and the four stories make for a really neat apartment. Jessica/Kim were very available but also made it easy to check in and out on our own. We had a great time.
30766133,564801717,2019-11-16,86938807,Julia,Ari and Garrett’s place was great! Really fantastic location that is close to downtown but not super busy and a very nice quiet street. They also provided little snacks and the room was super cute!
23749580,448772508,2019-05-05,248639497,Caleb,Is you are looking for a great clean place to stay I highly recommend this stop!
20475481,272583645,2018-06-03,27645646,Vincent,Stylish place with a welcoming host.  And big a friendly dog!
1959836,195545512,2017-09-19,77622959,Robert,"Anne, is a great host! This was my fist time staying at an Airbnb and the experience was just like a lot of previous reviews said it was. Your outside of the city in a nice quiet neighborhood, but not far from any attractions. With Anne, what you see is what you get,  she is upfront with her expectations, which isn't asking a lot and is very reasonable."
21182492,402784270,2019-01-19,93879849,Alexandra,A lot more worn and dingy than the pictures represent. Cute place but the bedding and linens were disappointing. The mattress is super soft and didn’t make for a good night’s rest. You can hear people walking around above.
7305805,84805015,2016-07-09,43032447,Terrie,"Carrie's house is a wonderful Airbnb property. The neighborhood
is very quiet and safe and as a single woman I felt very safe staying here. She has her Airbnb guests park in the garage which I loved, and the entrance to the basement apartment is from the garage into the
entry way. The apartment is not fancy but it suited my needs perfectly.
There is a small fridge, microwave, and coffee maker so it is
perfect for keeping breakfast items for the morning. There is a large living space and a separate bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom
is super quiet and cool so sleeping was awesome. Carrie met me as
I checked in and she is extremely friendly. She made me feel at home
and I was very comfortable at her property. I highly recommend this
property!"
632709,552911374,2019-10-22,26100692,Michael,Perfect spot for two couples and their pooch! Lots of great coffee shops made morning walks a delight. The neighborhood is beautiful with a great mix of old (small) houses and new (huge) houses with a lot of character. Restaurants are close from fancy-pants dining like Avanti to classic local Chubby's (slinging burritos since 1967). Great bars from dicey to chi-chi. The house itself is set up great with a nice back yard and a large kitchen and dining room. The bedrooms are upstairs and quiet so people can sleep and other people can hang out. Street parking was easy to find. All in all a great deal in a great city. Highly recommended.
7359477,186441623,2017-08-24,50201221,Jan-Kees,"Very nice place, located in a quiet and nice neighbourhood, walking distance from 16th street. Nicely furnished, comfy. I'd return if I would come back to Denver!"
33134111,436283621,2019-04-12,136062077,Shannon,"Van’s house was amazing! I was in town with a group of co-workers for a conference and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. The back deck was perfect for team dinners and the cube on the third floor was a great spot to hang out. All of the beds were comfortable, and even with five of us the house felt spacious. He was a great host, very accessible (and helpful when our group of Floridians got caught in a blizzard!). The neighborhood was quiet and very convenient to downtown. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique, upscale experience in Denver!"
13447168,244396283,2018-03-18,46038723,Romain And Darshaya,"It was just as th photos show. Extremely clean and cute.  The shower is nice. There is a space heater to stay warm. Great location. The bed was hard for me, but my husband loved it :) Sheets and towel were clean and smelled good. 
All in all great place with special touches and snacks."

29282321,512886828,2019-08-18,277178050,Jana,"We stayed at Megan's place for one night while we were in town for a wedding reception just up the road.  The guest suite is as cute as in the pictures, and absolutely clean and ready for us.  It felt very welcoming and there was an assortment of teas, a few snacks, waters, mini fridge, washer/dryer (which we didn't use but would have if we'd stayed longer), fresh towels and super soft bedding.  It was quite warm out and the A/C was set just right so it felt nice and cool the whole time we were there and was great for sleeping.  Megan was quick to respond before and during our stay.  I would definitely recommend this suite to anyone who was looking to stay in this area."
14488549,294914034,2018-07-22,73981548,Steve52359,Great communication!  In the heart of everything.  It doesn't get any more convenient.

Nathan was nice and responded fast to all my messages. I left my rings and he managed to found them and return them via mail to me. The house is big, modern and clean. A dream place for all kind of travel reason."

3425065,359960525,2018-12-18,227219421,민주,"It was pretty good, cozy room. The room is Quite smaller than I was expected but still clean and nice. I think this room is good for a solo guest. It was a bit uncomfortable that host sleeps right next to my room and it's easy for sharing a voice during day & night. But overall, she was really nice to help her guest, thanks."

We were tired and it was nearly 10pm.  To open a fridge and find a beer, orange juice and water waiting along with a cupboard with nuts and other snacks....well, it was amazing. We felt totally at home and in awe at the rustic charm and beauty of this little jewel that Mick transformed.  The only thing we missed was a sighting of the dog, Gunner.  I really wanted to meet him. 

Impeccable experience.  Nothing missing. So glad that  we could experience your space. "
28546903,362953182,2018-12-27,208950543,Adam,"Will and Mary welcomed us into their home with open arms. Prepare for animals as they have two sweet pets, Marlow a cat, and Hudson a dog. Both were very well-behaved. Will and Mary offered a lot of suggestions to help us get around the area. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I would recommend staying with Will and Mary."

The apartment has everything you need.  The little ""kitchen"" space was nicely appointed and the shower was great.  There is plenty of room for 2 to 4 people.
Check in was easy, and Tonya is very responsive.  She made sure to give us recommendations on local places, and there is some literature you can use to plan your stay.  Thanks, Tonya!  I'd love to stay here again!"

Couldn’t say enough good things about him as a host and the house as a whole. He was incredibly responsive and was even able to answer a few local questions for us. If you have the chance to book this house, don’t think twice and do it. 5 stars!"
15807599,164236802,2017-06-26,2180701,Angela,"This house made our vacation. It's very private and an absolute luxury stay. Uber was cheap to go to anything we wanted to do. The beds are comfortable and the showers were always hot and very clean. The host left us a great set up. Everything you would need is there: iron, blow dryer, even coffee.  The rooftop patio is the perfect hangout spot. The view is incredible and I can't say enough good things about the whole experience. Best place in Denver! "

With rooms on all levels, we were all able to spread out and have space to ourselves, while having the freedom to enjoy a beautiful common space on the main floor. All necessary amenities were available, even toiletries and various food items. The location was perfect and central to all of the sites we had planned to see. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We would definitely stay again on our next trip to Denver!"

8671797,529358334,2019-09-14,214531288,Nancy,"I can’t say more about how easy it was to stay here. If I had the choice, I would have moved in permanently!  The space was calm, extremely quiet, and simply easy.  Private entrance was perfect, coming and going was totally separated from the main house. Parking was super easy and just steps away from the gate to the carriage house.  I got to meet Rachel, her family and her French Bulldogs (because i missed my dogs terribly after a long trip away from home). They were so super nice and I loved their dogs!! They never bothered me and stayed very private in their home.  One thing if your legs are sore from hiking, long walks or if u have heavy bags, the staircase going up to the unit was decent but still manageable.  It was the perfect ending to a long vacation."

There were quite a few well-known-Denver-unique restaurants within walking distance from the airbnb. If not, it was a simple 4-8 minute Lyft/Uber/Taxi to our destination. He was very helpful and offered advice on where to go and what to do. However, other than the restaurants, there is a beautiful park that is less than a 2 minute walk from his house and is an absolutely wonderful place to run or take a stroll with your family.

We all stayed 6 nights. So we all showers every night never had a problem with the hot water or running out of towels. It was nice to have quite time with thr parents upstairs and the kids mostly teens downstairs playing pool. We loved how  efficient the washer and dryer work we did maybe 10 to 15 loads over the 6 days it was super nice just to go downstairs and wash clothes. We had plenty of sleeping space kids on the couches and floor but had plenty of blankets. I messaged the owners for more and with our surprise with in a few hourse had what we needed!! The house was spotless and had special touches. We couldn't wait to come ""home"" from the barns all day and hang out after a long day. Thank you for opening up your wonderful house!!

19892817,438048596,2019-04-15,148468864,Garin,"This property is an old (dark, drafty and with old creaky floors) duplex (not house) in a marvelous location, the Capitol Hill area of downtown Denver. Overall we had a wonderful time in the neighborhood boasting outstanding restaurants, coffee shops, parks and the Botanical Gardens, and it is located a short drive to downtown. Check in was a breeze, but we were disappointed with the paucity of available on-street parking due to numerous apartment buildings in the neighborhood. The unit was cleanish but not clean. Dust was thick on the tops of door and window trim, blinds and ceiling fans were dusty and sported abundant cobwebs, floor corners were dirty and there were several spots of mildew in the upstairs shower. The outdoor furniture on the front porch and in the backyard was not usable because it was dirty and/or needing repair and the ashtray in the backyard had old cigarette buts floating in water left from the recent snow. This was our first Airbnb stay and maybe our last; we expected a $300 per night property featured by Airbnb to be cleaner and in better repair."

22978126,300245922,2018-08-01,124444816,Nina,Great location. Close to downtown. Cute little coffee shop with a 5 minute walk. Very quiet and cute little place!

5103586,124766912,2017-01-02,30324410,Nicholas,"This was an amazing place to stay. Very clean and cultured space, we loved all of the unique artwork. Laney was very accommodating to all of our needs and always accessible if we had any questions. The neighborhood was excellent with very good food, great drinks, and great atmosphere. Everywhere we wanted to go was easily accessible either by walking, Uber, or public transit. Could not have asked for a better way to spend our time in Denver. "
7843605,250040493,2018-04-03,55111934,Morgan,Great apartment. Very spacious! Glad they had a parking space. The bed was sooo comfortable!

23034653,351369471,2018-11-22,30636094,Moona,"Vincent's place was clean, and exactly as the pictures promised. The neighbourhood was a bit sketchy (shootings nearby), so I would recommend using Uber in the night-time. Also, as the apartment is in the basement, it was a bit cold, but luckily there were heaters and extra blankets. Air conditioning was surprisingly loud, but it didn't bother us. One night part of the electricity went off, so Vincent very kindly came to check the situation! He was very pleasant and polite!

All in all, I would recommend this apartment, especially if you are staying longer. Very well grocery store nearby, and the train station is really close. It takes about 20 min to walk to the city centre, so I enjoyed the sunny weather and walked a lot in the daytime. Memorable business trip to Denver! Thank you Vincent!"

16324649,288794220,2018-07-10,126031235,Steve,6 out of 5 stars!! SUPER clean. Andy’s place was the best AirBnb I have ever stayed in. So stylish and extremely thoughtful. We used Andy’s washer and dryer and poorly timed the dryer time. Andy let us stay an extra 30 mins until our clothes were dry! MUST STAY!
24245200,559720262,2019-11-04,273019507,Jonathon,Great location!

1106479,497646653,2019-07-28,81266632,Michel,The place is nice and well decorated. The bed is on the small side of things. Good for one person but cramped for two.

13380198,484409654,2019-07-08,195051602,Jim,"This is a beautiful home. We stayed for a wedding nearby. The home is huge, clean and has a dream kitchen and plenty of space. Was a nice stay. Grocery shopping and other stores 3 minutes away. Not too far from downtown. Just a nice neighborhood house if you needed extra room for a larger group."
26130779,448769367,2019-05-05,244897218,Jimmi,"Such a pleasant place to stay. The house was immaculate, the amenities were awesome, and the location was accessible for everything I wanted and needed. I look forward to returning!"

21382434,244533258,2018-03-18,10196900,Jag,"Eric and Joan were the absolute best. They have a great home that's close to all the things that you want to do around Denver plus you get a cozy, nice place that you can call home.

I also learned a lot of other stuff like coffee making, bread making, and stuff about yoga!

Definitely stay at this place if you can :)"

Oh and they have really cute dogs!!"
25549371,280184727,2018-06-22,195789226,Douglas,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. The guest house was clean and comfortable. The parking was super convenient and you were both gracious hosts. I will definitely recommend your place to anyone coming in for a Denver Trip. Very close to my work and the commute was easy compared to Atlanta. Best of luck to both you and Scott. Thanks again!

Very uncomplicated!
Good communication! Perfect recommendations (train to Airport, ... )
I wish, I could come again!"

7948813,45519196,2015-09-03,5607837,Kerry,"This is an odd rental to review.  It is cute, well equipped, and tidy with great outdoor space.  And at the same time, when we rented, it was very filthy.  It is the first time that I have contacted Airbnb upon check-in.  It took them days to respond to my request for assistance in dealing with the uncleanliness factor.  In the end, they only refunded the cleaning fee.  If the host received professional cleaning services and removed more personal items, it could be a good rental."
19612462,504428515,2019-08-07,6848970,Lily,Great place to stay that is central to S Pearl St and Denver. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again.  Francisco was also very helpful with local tips and suggestions.

34089781,530447427,2019-09-15,18420560,Laura,"My husband and I stayed here for the weekend and loved the location and modern design of this space! It was perfect for what we needed since we spent most of our time exploring the city. We would agree that the bed wasn’t the most comfortable, but for only a few nights it wasn’t an issue. They provided a fan since there is no AC and it really helped to cool the space off at night. Overall very happy that we chose to stay here!"
28464192,538520509,2019-09-29,38708442,Ashley,Jacquelyn's place was perfect! Such a great place in a great location.

9201317,527331975,2019-09-10,63439088,Raina,"Very warm, clean, and stylish home in a great location! Check-in was a breeze, Allison was responsive, and there was plenty of street parking. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable!! It’s rare for me to say that but it’s true; definitely one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in on my travels. I appreciated the privacy as well as the little amenities offered in the space provided. Basement suite was a little too cold for me (I run cold) but the space heater definitely made it more comfortable. The space was nicely decorated and felt homey and inviting. Would stay again!"
23006749,294985831,2018-07-22,129719630,Billy,Matthew’s place was awesome. It has a great location and is very clean. I would highly recommend this air bnb.

24856267,442557681,2019-04-23,147396518,Jamie,We had a great stay at Luba’s spot. Great backyard and the hot tub was an awesome amenity!

13751109,162885355,2017-06-22,37766815,Robin,A great location!! Easy access via the 16th Street bridge to cross over into Lodo area. We walked and took the free mall bus when we needed a little break. Tracy's place is very clean and welcoming. Communication is excellent. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!
34148056,519535192,2019-08-28,169309549,Hunter,"The Airbnb was decorated very nicely. Amenities were great! A lot of extra bedding, which was nice. It was clean, and the beds were comfy. Very friendly host with great communication!

If you are in a hurry to leave the morning you are checking out, keep in mind that the host asks you to strip the beds and start the wash with all of the towels in it. There is no way to lock your items downstairs in the guest suite. There’s a front door, then a door to the upstairs suite where the owner’s live, and then no door to the downstairs suite. There is AC, but no control for the downstairs. Whatever the owner’s have the temperature set at upstairs is what it is set at for the Airbnb."
6515185,124346223,2017-01-01,48673587,Thomas,Great place to stay. Close to downtown and the host were amazing. Rad shower.

1724186,293179366,2018-07-19,70769679,Simon,"The accommodation included everything you needed and more: having access to a kitchen and a dining table (and a porch!) was all very valuable for some roadtrippers. All within walking distance from Downtown Denver. Jessica and Carl were great hosts, and were very welcoming and open in their own homes. "
12931856,168949612,2017-07-10,108059216,Todd,"What a wonderful home. It's in a great area, with access to everything.  Train station is too far to walk, but easily accessible with uber.  Tons of great restaurants, shopping and a movie theatre.  

The house is absolutely wonderful. Beautifully decorated, spacious and clean. The neighborhood is quiet but an easy walk to the lively area.  (Hidden by Airbnb) maps is a must for a day or two as it is easy to get turned around in the neighborhood. No worries here. "
21634081,456887611,2019-05-22,125900507,Dan,"Awesome stay!! Great location, the decorations were thoughtful and cute. Nice and roomy, and Nicole was extremely helpful and super sweet. Would love to visit again!"
25055975,279833705,2018-06-21,21328495,Jonathan,Grady's Farmhouse was fantastic. I travel more than 200 days a year and mostly stay in hotels. This Farmhouse was comfortable for myself and the 6 other guys I travel with. Located near the heart of downtown everything is close by. Grady was super easy to reach had we needed anything....We will stay here every time we roll through Denver.
21865169,469512081,2019-06-14,50861321,Stacy,"This airbnb went out of their way to make us feel welcome in Denver! I highly recommend staying here - not only was the Airbnb beautiful, welcoming and warm - the hospitality we received was the best. Thank you again to making our stay the amazing!"
2360382,23513614,2014-12-02,369470,Christina,"Mary Grace was a very hospitable host. The cottage is small but very clean. I wasn't able to stay due to a family emergency, unfortunately, but Mary Grace handled the situation in a timely manner. The cottage may not be in the best area of town, but it is close to the new mile high stadium , near highways and downtown- so that is a plus :)  "
8900843,276406602,2018-06-13,82663875,Ainul,Very convenient location from everything; loved it. Will be back in the future.
1911814,44975135,2015-08-30,41087635,Doug,Suite Sunnyside made for a great launchpad for our adventures in and around Denver. Randy and Dana were great hosts -- they truly seemed to care that we had a pleasant stay.

20324521,427451971,2019-03-23,79566051,Chelsey,"Such a beautiful place! Great location for us, quick responses, and generous touches (like snacks, shampoo & conditioner, etc.) for us to utilize as needed. The only thing I would suggest would be maybe a sheet of FAQ for the checking out process, etc. just so we wouldn’t feel like a bother to message any time we had a question or anything! 

Highly recommend though and would come back if we go back to Denver anytime!!"
38325627,556862142,2019-10-30,70641579,Kayla,Cute and cozy bungalow

We are glad we picked Matts place."
37914178,539624300,2019-10-01,187030916,Jordan,"Good ,clean place to stay if you aren’t high maintenance and need a bed for a night . 4/20 friendly ,and the owner provided Accessories for smoking."
34089787,474082735,2019-06-22,45288072,Wesley,"Spot on reviews! Alex was super accommodating and easy going. Beautiful corner unit views and amenities (rooftop lounge, salt water pool, 4000+ sq ft. gym) made it all worth it. Minor annoyance not having on-site garage parking, but the location is convenient enough that you wouldn't need a car anyway. If you don't mind a short walk, Dairy Block has very reasonable overnight rates with in/out privileges. One of the things I appreciated is that this high rise building actually welcomes Airbnb guests. Usually, I expect to have to be discrete; this was a refreshing change. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Alex!"
31364596,460591659,2019-05-29,53234268,Anna,"Overall, you get what you pay for. Nicco was helpful and communicative. Location was decent, about 11min walk to downtown, but in a sketchy area (homeless people sleep outside the building). Don’t recommend washing your clothes as the dryer did not work, and there was no dish soap for the dishwasher. When we arrived there were crumbs on the couch and dust covered furniture. Don’t recommend looking under the bed. Also the deck is not private, it’s an entry way into 3 apartments. Overall, decent cheap option but could’ve been better!"
20248046,206487075,2017-10-25,838574,Tara,"We had a fantastic stay. It was a pleasure being in lovely space with beautiful things, everything from the furniture to the cups. Quiet, which was great for sleeping, and within walking distance to eating, coffee shops, even dispensaries."
1145324,69746173,2016-04-13,42543330,John,"I cannot say enough GREAT things about my stay with Juliet! I only wish that I sold have stayed longer! Juliet has a wonderful, welcoming, friendly and beautiful spirit-her home is gorgeous and should be a model for other Air B & B Hosts. The location is amazing, the house is immaculate and inviting, cozy and warm. My only complaint is that I couldn't have stayed longer-this time  ;)"

We were able to walk into the city in no time and also explore bars/restaurants close by. We really enjoyed it! I would recommend staying with Ashley to anyone. She was very kind and helpful.
14800540,498956188,2019-07-30,261714645,Mariam,Awesome location! Kathryn was very accommodating and her place was clean and perfect for our group. Very close to everything downtown. Will definitely stay here again next time!

35182176,535071926,2019-09-23,291348399,Thien,"The place is sparkling clean and it resides at the the center of Denver downtown.

AC is a little bit uncomfortable. One day we came home and the house is hot and hard to breath with no air flow at all. However the host immediately fixed the issue (by turning the AC on). During our last night, the AC seems to be not working as well as we found it very hot at the middle of the night. The AC needs to run so air can flow through the house.

Other than that, there is nothing else to complain about."
33613259,559780004,2019-11-04,152122616,Chris,This is a very clean space located near the Denver Broncos stadium and close to downtown Denver. The neighborhood is cozy and quiet and check-in was seamless.  Highly recommended!

8372001,290023048,2018-07-13,36984299,Meagan,"A friend and I booked Emma's place last minute for a work trip, and we were so pleased with our decision to stay! They made it very easy to check in and gave us clear directions. The dogs were a huge bonus!! They were so sweet and we had a great time giving them some love upon each arrival and departure :) The room was spacious, clean, comfortable - and the location was in perfect relation to everything we could have hoped to experience in Denver. We were so happy to have found this Airbnb and would definitely come back when we find ourselves in Denver again! "

19842530,193733800,2017-09-14,79116695,Louise,"Freshly painted with lovely wooden floors, this place makes a great first impression. The shower had plenty of hot water. Bed was comfortable.
You are a guest in someone's home, so the closet has limited room. 
Just bear in mind, it's a bachelor pad, missing some of the things women might expect (e.g. hair dryer, per the description), but as it's a newish listing, those things might improve over time. 
Literally next door is a hipster grocery store, with a wine dept. There's a bar / restaurant at the same intersection. No problem getting an Uber at 5.30am to the airport, and an easy walk to downtown."
8211278,559697817,2019-11-04,266509753,Robby,Great home for large groups of people. The home is older but well worth it for the price we paid over a weekend. Debbie and Stew were both very accommodating and were available to reach out to if we so needed. As far as the house goes everything was great. The house runs a little warm due to the high power of the old furnace but other than that everything was great. Would definitely recommend staying here!
23453925,503341366,2019-08-05,210809625,Nalleli,"The room can get a little warm during the summer months, so  be prepared for that. The windows remain open in the summer in a effort to circulate air and keep the room cool. The bed was very comfortable, but the comforter is heavy again for the summer months. Other than that a nice, quick, efficient stay!"
23189744,328286690,2018-09-25,32607050,Felix,"Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen und haben uns direkt wohl gefühlt. Jennifer hat uns gute Tipps gegeben und für uns z.B. auch einen Zahnarzt besorgt. Das alte Haus ist sehr schön eingerichtet, sehr gemütlich, gepflegt und absolut sauber. Zusätzlich gibt es zwei sehr nette Katzen. Ein Supermarkt ist ~5 Gehminuten entfernt und mit dem Bus ist man in ca 10min direkt im Stadtkern. Insgesamt eine super Sache!"
5347637,30619328,2015-04-25,29740252,Virginia,The listing description was accurate. The place was really clean! Greg added a few personal touches and made every effort to make sure we were comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!
5630819,446936046,2019-05-02,22858281,Nicole,This was our third stay and as always gretta’s was perfect! She is so incredibly thoughtful and goes the extra mile for her guest!

20624536,340356099,2018-10-23,66329703,Andrew,A really cool spot right in the heart of downtown.  Really stylish and nice touches like plenty of toiletries.   We had a wonderful stay in Denver.
8860548,550972452,2019-10-19,298287426,Shane,Awesome place very safe and comfy . Adrian was prompt in her communication and place was clean and quite. Would definently stay again!
1223612,49280024,2015-10-02,501920,Nancy,"My stay was way too short! I was sad to leave the comforts of Cynthia’s sweet space. 

My interaction with Cynthia was brief. I was barely at the house...didn’t even have time to enjoy a cup of tea from Cynthia’s well-stocked kitchen… 

I arrived after midnight on my first night after a flight delay, and Cynthia graciously waited up for me, standing by her cell phone to return each and every one of my text messages. Upon my late arrival, she even took the time to give me a grand tour of the manor! (She had a lot more energy than did!)

Will definitely stay again when I’m back in Denver!  (Hopefully, next time, for more than just two nights.)

13789796,134732741,2017-02-28,118355897,Sheng,Very comfortable and clean.  Close to downtown.  Great value.  Check-in process was extremely easy.
16163913,313037384,2018-08-24,6472516,Jack,The reviews are correct. Very comfortable accommodations. We’ll be back!
27599458,418282777,2019-03-01,15236333,Palomitay,Excellent!
21013551,199971603,2017-10-03,69059884,Claudia,The art around the house is awesome. There are two lovely cats roaming around. The room is cozy and welcoming. Great place!
29489384,498486822,2019-07-29,2195078,Jennifer,"Don't expect too much besides a comfy place to sleep, a bathroom to use, and a kitchen if you need it - and you'll be just fine! The house is very modern and comfortable. Toiletries provided are minimal and not the best quality. Your experience will largely depend on who is sharing the house with you and if they clean after themselves.

Pros:
* Location is close enough to Capitol Hill and the Civic Center so you can walk ~15 minutes and get to other parts of downtown easily, although there are closer bus stops depending where you want to go.
* Cost - Probably the cheapest place you may find if you're on a budget
* Good for meeting people
* Large fridge and equipped kitchen, plus purified water

Cons:
* Security - Not enough lockers for everyone (remember to bring your own lock) and sometimes guests would forget to lock the front door. Nobody inside the house seemed fussed about securing their own property (phones and tablets left charging unattended).
* Noise - If you choose the 1st floor, you have fewer people to share the room with but you have more noise from the street. The 2nd floor has more beds including the two with the black shades, but otherwise you should expect a lot of light. It's also not a true separate room but a partitioned section of the 2nd floor with the common areas.
* Location - Some people loiter across the street
* Cleanliness in shared areas could use improvement
* Only two bathrooms shared among 12-14 people - difficult when everyone is getting ready in the morning, long wait times

I recommend if: you are on a budget, want to meet new people, can handle a decent amount of noise, and are not too picky with your cleanliness standards"
37749713,537455947,2019-09-28,192712105,Tina,"My expectations for the place were exceeded! This place was spectacular for the reason of my stay. Rooms were large, beds were comfy, towels were provided for all of our guests, there was shampoo/conditioner and body wash for usage (if you are not sensitive to their products this was a great touch for a quick wash up), a fridge to place leftovers/drinks. A cute touch up to the common area was the paintings! Very lovely. The only thing to be wary about are the quiet hours not listed in the description and to be cautious about your time finding street parking. Definitely book this place if you are looking for a quick stay for an adventurous day/night out in Denver."
18582812,300690436,2018-08-02,94971348,Nicole,We enjoyed our stay Mark was great and so was his apartment!

39405,12111855,2014-04-23,10671247,Ryan,"Our stay at the cottage was great! The cottage was very cozy and the hosts were very welcoming and friendly. I loved the neighborhood being very close to many of the main Denver attractions, and only a few blocks off the highway making it easy to find.  We will definitely be staying here again when we come to denver. "
18304991,251336763,2018-04-07,171288275,Gail,Aaron and Mallori were the perfect hosts!   Mallori even made extra coffee in the mornings to help me get adjusted to the time change!  Their house is adorable and their dog Banner is such a cutie!  We will definitely try to book with them again for our next visit to Denver!
13751968,362620551,2018-12-26,131040034,Judy,"Brooks place was very nice!
Charming and decorated nicely.
Plenty of towels and bed linens.
Close to downtown Denver and

Just a word not handicapped  accessible"

21811514,446544855,2019-05-01,73106591,Carlo,"This place was awesome! If you're looking for a place for two people of different genders on a business trip where you need two separate bedrooms, I highly recommend this place. Amenities are amazing, the iron is fantastic and the entire space is just calm quiet and comfortable. Michelle has very good taste in high-end design and it shows which adds to it being a very comfortable environment. For sure I would highly recommend this place and do plan to return should I ever come back in this area."
3410364,130113991,2017-02-04,2617429,Jasmine,"Alison is the ideal Airbnb host: responsive, thoughtful, helpful...welcoming. Everything! It's the basement level of her home and it is super private. I felt like I had my own little house (you get your own bathroom, bedroom and separate living area). I booked my listing at the very last minute and arrived late at night. Alison was fantastic through it all. If you stay here, there is a cute (and yummy) little coffee shop with delicious food, called Weathervane. Had a homemade poptart, chia coconut pudding and lavender black tea. Yum! "
3968613,55125309,2015-11-28,10029831,Aljaz,Erika was a great host. The neighborhood is excellent as well. I will be happy to return.

17175955,358533177,2018-12-14,6619101,Carl,"Perfection. The host, the house, the furniture. Great place to stay with swanky touches and comfort throughout. Everything was super convenient. Fast internet. Great cable tv. Luxury beds and linens. I wish Airbnb had star rating levels because this is an upper class of level."
12186872,314357174,2018-08-26,19044760,Karen,"This Airbnb was cute, clean and in a great location. The pull out bed was super comfortable as well. Thanks for having us!"
21897185,354998681,2018-12-02,48915159,Lisette,Very comfortable and clean place! It was nice to come back to a private space at the end of the day. Their dog was adorable too!
26566337,454598102,2019-05-18,42274846,Jordan,"We really enjoyed our time at Kelsey’s place! It is super cute and a great location, comfy bed, and nice amenities. May not be ideal for those with pet allergies (dog hair was around - didn’t bother us a ton, but could be problematic for some)."
16522375,448884693,2019-05-05,129080815,Jenna,Really great place to stay in Denver. The location was great! Apartment was beautiful and stocked with everything you could need. Would highly recommend.
16313550,148421471,2017-04-30,9885353,Will,"We really enjoyed this place. Parking was easy considering the central location, and there were lots of options for dining and recreation within walking distance. I would recommend it."
14787426,190724494,2017-09-04,30100782,David,"Great location in the Highlands with easy access to almost anything. Perfect little basement apartment for one or two. Everything was clean and ready for my stay. Queen sized mattress was a bonus and a comfort. There is a pooch on the premise, but a bark here and there did not bother me a bit. Love the neighborhood and hope to return soon."
5956309,65671007,2016-03-16,44544139,John,"Room exactly as described. Easy communication with host, easy access, and clean beds. Would stay again!"

Wajdi would do anything to help you in any way, it was like staying with a childhood friend. This is a hidden gem of a find."
15631740,420733260,2019-03-07,87506284,Alex,The place was great. Plenty of space and a perfect location with everything we could have wanted to explore within walking distance. Checkin was convenient and easy. Definitely recommend this place!
24766200,281793434,2018-06-25,61874453,Meredith,Wonderful hosts! Perfect location! Spacious basement apartment that was well lit with windows and recessed lighting. Had all the comforts of home and was in the hip Highland area just off Tennyson street. 
25918224,356543668,2018-12-08,192273667,Matt,"Place was super clean and very comfortable!  Nicely renovated, great space!  Would highly recommend for anyone looking to stay near downtown, a ten dollar Uber ride to everything!"

28617385,327441909,2018-09-23,202395082,Chris,"This is a beautifully restored condo in close walking distance to most of what downtown Denver has to offer.  And if you can't walk there, the train stop is only a block away.

Of particular note for us was Wood's Boss Brewery only 1.5 blocks away, Spangalang Brewing 3 blocks away and all of the 5-points music destinations and late night pizza.

From door to Convention Center was a really nice 20 minute walk with myriad options for dining along the way."
20914531,517742643,2019-08-25,21212597,Alannah,"Great little place! We only stayed for a short time so can’t speak to cooking etc but location was great, amenities were great, bed was comfy, hosts were communicative and readily available and check in was a breeze. If you’re a light sleeper, I’d suggest an eye mask or something. It’s VERY bright, which is amazing, but rough in the morning for those who like to sleep in!"
22362499,488139955,2019-07-14,33067822,Andrea,A nice airport layover spot. Host has a knack for thoughtful guest amenities which are placed throughout the basement apartment. The washer/dryer combo was a nice bonus! We really enjoyed our stay and I’d definitely stay here again.
756594,259297867,2018-05-01,51301378,Mil,"Ling & Chris son muy amables. El sótano es muy cálido y confortable. Ofrecen muchos detalles fundamentales para sentirse como en casa. 
Fotos muy reales. Volveremos sin duda."
24868230,303608167,2018-08-07,16585504,Virginia,"We couldn't have been happier with our stay at Kelly's lovely home. It was the perfect spot for our family, traveling with a 2.5 year old and 3 month old.  The home is beautifully decorated and comfortably appointed. The beds were comfortable, and a pack and play was provided as well. We especially enjoyed the back yard and front porch, where we enjoyed a summer rain storm. I was pleasantly surprised that they even provided all the necessary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and toothpaste) to allow people to travel really light. 

The home was well located, with a short drive to most attractions, and lots of cute restaurants nearby. We loved going to Buchi, a three minute walk, for breakfast or cuban sandwiches. 

Overall, it was among our favorite airbnb's we have ever stayed in. "
59631,30153741,2015-04-18,602273,Harriet,Julie's place was absolutely lovely.  She was a wonderful host!

20420195,183588347,2017-08-17,25563720,Kevin,"Dylan's place is brand new and downtown is easily accessible from his house.  He lets his guests park their cars in his garage, so you don't have to worry about bad weather.  I arrived before he was home from work, but he left the code to the garage and a set of keys to the house.   He also sent me the wifi information ahead of time.  He doesn't have pets, so the entire house was very clean.  Guests have a private bathroom.  As for the host himself, Dylan is great guy with a wonderful personality.  He recommended a good place for dinner and a good place for breakfast the next morning.  I will be back."
31566077,494628406,2019-07-24,177828170,Barton,Super location with an Easy Button!  Thanks Aaron.

The pictures are spot on, it is as nice as it seems. very narrow garage area, not idea for big vehicles. Close to everything."
16807778,147272953,2017-04-25,40632791,Alex,"This was a nice, comfortable place to stay, and saved us some money by being so close to the airport! "
5696654,531522002,2019-09-17,56639251,Alexandra,"The place is in a great location, has great amenities. A few things that happened during our stay were 1. There were 2 wasps inside the house and a few more downstairs where the laundry is. 2. There were two big spiders  in the ceiling and 3. A big moth came from the kitchen into the bedroom at night. 

I see everyone else’s great reviews and wonder if we had bad luck this one time. Other than the bugs the place was great. The neighbors upstairs smoke weed a lot and you can smell it strongly downstairs. That’s more of an FYI if you’re not used to it. It didn’t bug us at all."
11521979,325399487,2018-09-19,20419454,Emily,Jenna's place is so clean and modern. It has all the modern amenities for a business traveler or a couple. The space is right off the street and close to downtown. Great for a little stay when passing through Denver.
17556772,562463874,2019-11-10,15876176,Maria,"This is a fantastic apartment! Harold was so easy to work with. It is spotless with a very comfy bed, nice hip decor and a big kitchen. It is on a beautiful street, just a block from gorgeous Cheesman Park. Although there is a coffeemaker, I walked a block every morning to Dazbog Coffeeshop, which opens super early. I totally recommend this wonderful airbnb!"
746298,160561639,2017-06-14,13537943,Robert,"This was a lovely place to stay, and Mary was a wonderful host. The home was well-furnished, with a comfortable bed, full bath, and a modern well-designed kitchen. There was a comfortable sitting area on the ground floor with a TV and library, and a powder room available for visitors. Laundry facilities were available had I needed them. The home is located in a new, walkable, very pleasant neighborhood close to shops, restaurants, and the Air Museum. It was perfect for me, and close to the home of a friend that I was visiting. Mary was a gracious host, and provided fresh fruit and a loaf of banana bread. There was a coffee pot and coffee makings available for my use every morning. She was very flexible in meeting my schedule for arrival and check-out. I would be very pleased to stay in this location again, if my travel plans lead me to Denver in the future."

The space is clean with thoughtful amenities and full of personal touches. We had three adults and the space worked perfectly for us. Also, the couch is the most comfortable sleeping couch ever!

14732176,210145256,2017-11-07,46312307,Rosemary,"Beautiful home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. The room was large and bed was comfortable, ample space for all my belongings. You may prefer to also use the space heater (which they provide) in the winter, which keeps the room cozy. Spacious and clean bathroom with great water temperature/pressure. Parking was plenty and the house is just a stone's throw away from the park. Perfect for those who will have a car, but those without can always rely on the public transportation nearby (bus and bike share, though I didn't have to use either). I would definitely stay again if I find myself in Denver in the future!"
25141789,325763888,2018-09-20,204752502,Shelby,"I would 100% recommend staying at Kayla and Derek’s place. Not only was the house charming and in a great location, Kayla was an amazing host! She gave many suggestions on local spots for good food, drink, and entertainment. She even went above and beyond and sent me back an item I had forgot in the house. Such a great experience, and if I’m ever in Denver again, I will definitely be renting from Kayla and Derek!"
24302966,448921300,2019-05-05,56856042,Ryan,Overall a very good place to stay. In an up and coming neighborhood but about 2 blocks off from the main area. Place was clean and big enough for a group of 6 all in separate beds. The host was good at communicating and being available.
861993,366972922,2019-01-03,22374006,Abby,John and Shann’s place was easy and comfy for a quick one night stay.
2267500,151650833,2017-05-13,32829424,Gracie And Chris,Everything was great! Cory's place is in a quiet bungalow that's really conveniently located. It was a nice home away from home while I was in town for a training. 
31117836,445171527,2019-04-28,138604670,James,"Fantastic three story home in an awesome location. We walked or scooter'd everywhere since it was so close to bars, restaurants, the train station, the ball park, downtown, etc. Great place to stay. And it has an elevator which was super nice on those long late nights when you maybe don't want to walk up the stairs. The bedrooms are not all together, though, one is kind of by itself and is much cooler in temperature it seemed than the rest of the house. Not a complaint though, just a heads up. Although the property is in close proximity to a lot of great places to eat and drink, there was never any excessive noise coming from the street. This was our first time to Denver and we had a great time in no small part due to this house. The common area was perfect for everyone to get together and plan out our day. Full kitchen, fast internet, super clean, lovely decor, charming neighborhood, and excellent host! Benjamin responded to my questions promptly and was very accommodating to our unfortunate arrival and departure times.  This is my 5th time using Airbnb, and honestly one my favorites. If Denver is on your list, make sure to check this property out; it is just about perfect. Thanks for everything Ben! Cheers!"
13494022,526198516,2019-09-08,172018320,Hannah,"We were only in town for 24 hours, but this place was perfect. Clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to a ton of fun places to eat and drink. Very short drive to the museum and the park. Communication was great and check in was easy. Despite not technically being a “whole apartment” Airbnb, we felt we had total privacy in our separate space. We would definitely stay here again!"

3960763,306590176,2018-08-12,48502797,Jonathan,"Had a great relaxing weekend at Julie’s. The house is so close to so many things - you wouldn’t necessarily need to even have a car if you flew in. We did, and took a 1.5 hr drive to Estes Park, 20 mins to Dinosaur Ridge, and 1 hour to Colorado Springs. 

Biggest thing we loved - you’re right by broadway and all it has to offer, but somehow it’s still so quiet and peaceful in the backyard. Can’t even hear the traffic."
15817834,554138753,2019-10-25,72587355,Will,Had a comfortable stay at Ashley’s place. Easy check in and well kept

It's a walkable distance to all the fun spots in RiNo.  We had three people stay and we all slept super well and had more than enough space.  Super convenient and so many great amenities in this space.  Will definitely be staying here again.

26261457,492783064,2019-07-21,118114005,Alysia,The place was very cute and clean. It had dishes needed for at home cooking and plenty of space for groceries. The only issue was not having air.
18871415,488115275,2019-07-14,113385909,Meghana,"We had a very pleasant stay!! House was cozy and nice.  Host had written all the details that was required, that way we didn’t have to ask the host for every little things.  Location was close to downtown."
15978051,121723092,2016-12-18,107559132,Dylan,"I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon Judy & Doc!
They have a lovely marriage that is pleasant to be around. 
They made me feel at home with a terrific home cooked meal and we watched a movie like a family.
They also supported me being out late on the town, sharing their knowledge of the city.
I'm gonna take another trip here soon just to visit them!
Thank you guys!!!!!"
30463025,441321292,2019-04-21,236532697,Brett,This place is ablsolutly amazing. You are only minutes away from the city and so many places to check out. It is about 20-25 minutes from some hiking attractions but the home located a couple minutes from the freeway. Would 100% recommend to anyone looking to checkout Denver.
30110319,514757913,2019-08-21,237669721,Mileena,"The place itself is very beautiful! I loved the high ceilings and outdoor patio. The neighborhood is safe and cozy with so many restaurants and cafes around of different cuisines (also a few dispensaries!). The host was very responsive with me which made the trip much easier. My boyfriend and I pretty much ubered everywhere, but they weren’t crazy expensive, maybe about $5-10. I would be open to staying here again if I’m ever in Denver. In a message from the host before our arrival, we were told that the owners in the other house wouldn’t really be around, but for the time we were there, we ran into them pretty often and much noise came from their backyard construction so I’d say that was the only downfall but I’m sure we just caught the week of their project."
4545539,63785175,2016-02-27,52269163,Meghan,LOVED staying in this home! Perfect for our two-day stay in Denver 
25341724,317791238,2018-09-02,91406511,Dawn,"Do not be afraid to stay here because there are not a ""lot"" of reviews yet.  
This place is totally adorable!  Sparkling clean! Private and quiet! You can walk the streets with peace of mind and enjoy the stately and beautiful homes in this historic neighborhood. Absolutely LOVED my stay here. 
Well stocked with coffee, snacks and toiletries. The washer and dryer were a fantastic plus. Amanda is a wonderful host and was able to respond quickly to help me get in and situated as I had a late arrival flying in from out of state. 
I visit National Jewish health several times a year and I would very happily choose this beautiful yet vintage cottage again!  The kitchen and bath are brand new!
Thank you Amanda, what a wonderful set up you have in the Mayfair Cottage!  
Kindest regards, Dawn Wang"
24746875,309088195,2018-08-17,57578351,Grant,"This place is very nice and clean. It is basically a refinished basement, which is really nicely done. There was not a sink or stove, but everything else you would ever need was there. The couches and beds were very nice and comfortably accommodated 4 of us. We even rode the Lime scooters back to this place from the City Park and the RINO district. Full disclosure, its not necessarily an area you would want to walk around at night, but a very short Uber/Lyft ride away, or even an electric scooter. "
16548314,175748465,2017-07-29,16380892,Seth,The place was great! Super comfortable bed and a very unique bathroom. Heating lamps were definitely a plus. Close to a lot of restaurants and different Denver activities.
16163913,238349978,2018-02-25,105974293,Kayse,The house is a beautiful place and the location even better! I’d definitely come here again.

20170743,207713197,2017-10-29,92680171,Chris,"Brady's place was great, it was just a few blocks from the convention center where I was attending a work conference. Its in a nice neighborhood very close to downtown, and was very accommodating. Brady was awesome, and worked with me to figure out some last minute details that were really appreciated. Brady went out of his way to make sure my trip and stay there were perfect, and I really appreciated his help."

15314730,276105736,2018-06-12,84753947,Cherille,"This house was amazing and it exceed the expectations. The pictures does not capture everything. We stayed a week and it made it feel like our home away from home. 

Tip: if you wake up early in the morning 6-9 you will see bunnies hopping across the lawn peacefully. "
22769182,564347139,2019-11-15,266411648,Joseph,Place was amazing . Close to everything in downtown Denver . A little bit of a walk but totally worth it . Towels and sheets were extremely clean and smelled great . Great stay
8718728,236881951,2018-02-20,161727644,Emily,If you want a vacation. STAY HERE!!!!
18211893,201644773,2017-10-08,28442558,Samir,"The house a great place to stay with friends, with plenty of space, bedrooms, and a nice entertaining space in the kitchen/living room.  The location is great - about a 10 min drive to downtown (across the river) or 10 min Uber.  There are plenty of nice places in the neighborhood, including cool coffee shops (Cherry Bean Coffee), craft beer gastropubs, and quick eats.  There is a really good cask and wine store across the street.  It's also in a quiet neighbourhood where we could get a good night's sleep.
Our only challenge was that we were told we could check in early the day before arrival.  However, on the day arriving, we were informed we would only be able to check in at 4pm which required us to change our plans that day.
I would recommend staying and Zach and Tiffany's house"
13494022,126814131,2017-01-14,80145934,Abigail,Jacob's place was great and just what we needed.
4191778,209655538,2017-11-05,43045478,Patrick,Erin's place was nice. The bedclothes seemed to be freshly washed (and free of hair) which is important to me. Some nice breakfast items in the fridge and good kitchen. If walking in after dark be aware the streets have few lights. A bus stop is about a 3 minute walk from the place. One negative was the bathroom was not as clean as it could have been.
22907087,442556363,2019-04-23,73450751,Mallory,This place is STUNNING!! It’s in a great location just minutes away from everything! And super easy access to the highways.

Jason even graciously helped us pull together last minute Halloween costumes! The place is less than ten minutes by Uber to downtown and there is a decent amount of fun within walking distance. The hot tub was truly amazing during a snow storm. I would stay with Jason again!"
20917414,273306506,2018-06-05,129242351,Sarah,"This place is absolutely wonderful! Kevin was responsive and friendly, the location boasted a quick walk to hotspots like the Botanic Gardens & Voodoo Doughnuts, and the natural light from the skylights was lovely. There is a market nearby (less than half a block) for quick groceries/amenity needs. It was also right across the street from one of my fave Denver restaurants! 

We had all the amenities we could need, and there were even books and games to pass time if needed. The spacious apartment made for an excellent stay."

We only found that there seemed to be a limit with the hot water when showering as it went cold quiet quickly but we managed to make it work. Thanks for having us! Would recommend.
24716577,435826484,2019-04-11,5041407,Alaya,"Super cute place. Location is great. So much nearby. Check-in was easy and it was easy enough to find nearby street parking. I would just note that it's not a fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, etc.) if you're hoping to do your own cooking."

Herbert was a great host and the location is most ideal for easy access and cheap($6)  Uber/Lyft rides to LoDo and other cool places downtown 

If needed, we would book his place again for future use."
21151336,203270985,2017-10-14,104803661,Andrea,Hanna's place was absolutely beautiful. The area in which the home is built is very quaint. This Airbnb was perfect for our stay and I would highly suggest it to anyone that wishes to spend time in Denver.

She was a gracious, considerate, very warm host. There's a reason her reviews are so high - a very welcoming woman."
81540,1188676,2012-04-27,2047580,Lisa,"Great, central location. Perfect accomodations for 2 people. Be prepared for a tiny bathroom, but otherwise great. We're looking forward to moving to Denver and recommending a stay with Jess for any guests we can't fit!"

Definitely, I will stay here again."

She was very welcoming and helpful, going out of her way to help us feel at home. The room was clean and I had no trouble sleeping, with a variety of pillows and linens. We woke up to coffee, a hot shower and cereal wich was very nice. Jill even offered us a ride wich was not needed but really appreciated for someone in the area for a few days. We had a good time chatting and were on our way, it was everything I expected and then some. Thank you! I strongly recommend this room :)"

My flight was so delayed I didn’t get in til 1am and the apartment is well lit and easy to get into. Parking is convenient and there a lot of walkable breakfast and lunch spots. There is a lake near by with a walking trail for exercise i went for a run at every morning. Very easy on and off of all the Colorado highways which made exploring very easy. Highly recommend!
36529332,535122261,2019-09-23,50547934,Olivia,"Stacy’s little apartment was very cute and clean, we had a wonderful stay. There’s no tv if that’s a concern for you but it wasn’t for us!

23143199,327395631,2018-09-23,11047531,Paige,"This was a great space for us (a group of 4 close friends) for a weekend. Good things we learned: the stairs leading to the loft are narrow – if you're clumsy and hate carrying suitcases you might be in for a trip here. Parking in this neighborhood is tricky! If you are driving budget extra time for parking and walking! Those two things aside, overall great place. Clean, close to EVERYTHING, and a great value for Denver."
4180622,251286267,2018-04-07,110059672,Sun,"We used this space as a retreat for a team meeting, so I can’t attest to what the experience would be overnight. However, it was perfect for our needs and it was very well appointed with thoughtful touches throughout."

15846078,468551551,2019-06-12,110866673,Jenny,"Tama is very responsive. Her place is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, and is as described. One thing to note, the listing does mention pets and talks about her two dogs, which are very well behaved, but she also has cats, so if you are allergic, take note. Overall a fine place to stay for a short period of time."
23685442,492963192,2019-07-21,226994700,Emma,This space is super clean and has lots of amenities. It is super close to downtown Denver. It is close to Morrison (we saw a show at Red Rocks) and close to Boulder (we went on a hike at Chautauqua Park). Safe location as well. This is a great place and the host is very kind. A good place to call home for a weekend!!

18355719,425234401,2019-03-17,44840378,Irene,"The house is very clean but at the same time super cozy. I felt welcome from the very beginning. Sarah is a friendly and warm host , helpful and responsive. Absolutely recommended !"
24038986,260106008,2018-05-03,176403406,Lauren,This is such a fantastic place!   Rebeckah and the owners have done a fantastic job and Rebekah is so quick to respond. They really went all out to help me and make a few switches to accommodate my needs.  Can’t wait to see you again next month!!
13171401,147813086,2017-04-28,126642047,Brandon,"Shelby & Jon were fantastic host. We were only there for a couple days and they were very helpful in providing us with information about the area. 

The living space was very nice, clean, and private. As an added bonus, the dogs are very friendly and enjoy attention :) We highly recommend Shelby & Jon's place for anyone traveling to Denver! "
26400468,300241129,2018-08-01,71590598,Angela,"Tina's home  is lovely. The place was very clean and in a perfect location for me as I wanted to be close to DU and Wash Park. Tina is very friendly, pleasant and helpful. I will look forward to staying at her place again. "
24118993,366971443,2019-01-03,1745596,Keith,I enjoyed my 3 day stay here over the New Year. Its a comfortable space and I found the location ideal for my needs. Close to everything but still felt private and quiet. Entertaining view of the rail yard. Colleen was quick to communicate and check in was easy. I'd definitely stay here again.
21993592,265575757,2018-05-17,175575528,Katarina,"The apartment is conveniently about 5 minutes from the Union Station and one can take a $9 train directly from the airport to Union Station. The neighborhood has a Whole Foods and tons of cafes and restaurants. The art museums are about a 10 minute ride away and near the apartment is a lovely park. 
The apartment has all the amenities needed for a brief visit including full kitchen and washer and drier. Vince was incredibly responsive. I would stay there again."

27878938,449519935,2019-05-06,6878058,Julia,This house was great for our needs. We had a group of girls who all traveled to Denver to explore a new (to us) city. The home provided plenty of space for the group and we were able to spend time both indoors and outdoors and enjoyed both areas! Erik and Kristen were prompt with any and all communications I had beforehand and check in was very easy.
11277311,295067539,2018-07-22,199241692,Dennis,"Great space and very nice hosts. Clean and comfortable. In a great location, near restaurants, bars, local attractions. Teddy provided detailed instructions that allowed for an easy check-in."
12990793,252681836,2018-04-11,422423,Tom,"Patricia's place was great, easy check in, very comfortable bed! Very close to RiNo area for some great brewpubs. Would definitely stay again."
11191271,102286020,2016-09-17,51130781,Megan,Great place to stay. It was centrally located and easy to get to. Uber rides to downtown were about $6 and well worth it. Great space. King bed is a little to soft for my liking but everything was clean and Chris was super helpful. No garage parking either. 
19180922,266268943,2018-05-19,158869352,Jacob,"This location was as cute as could be, the place was spotless when we showed up. You enter through an adorable side street and walk down into the coziest basement/apartment of all time! The apartment had a clean and modern feel, the smart tv was amazing for catching up on some Netflix documentaries. Don’t let me forget to mention the INCREDIBLE food spots near by. A restaurant called Linger and an ice cream shop called Little Man were a five minute walk away and completely rocked my entire existence. Caroline was the host of my dreams, gave us full privacy and was so great with responding quick and being there to help if we needed. They were even friendly enough to warn us about charges we might have accrued on our bicycles that we rented. Who is that sweet?!? If I come back to Denver I am totally going to try hard to reserve this place again! I highly suggest you stay here!"
22305207,229290946,2018-01-22,3362423,Joanna,"Our stay was AWESOME!  The place is spectacular... The layout, the design elements, the furnishings, the location, the kitchen, the little touches...all wonderful.  The attention to care and anything we might need was perfect.  We had a small gathering for my birthday and it was absolutely perfect.  My friends and I loved it!  (Oh, and soaking in the master tub was icing on the cake!) "
30349203,502543513,2019-08-04,243935807,Joshua,Great place!
17556772,188825554,2017-08-30,48086990,Steven,"Harold's place was as advertised. The place is very nice, clean, and comfortable, with a separate entrance. Harold was communicative but not forceful. And the neighborhood is beautiful, pleasant, and still pretty central."
21190815,239178937,2018-02-28,158728110,Jane,"Emily's condo was in the perfect location for us...across the street from a 5 mile walking trail, 5 minute walk to the best shopping in CO with many independently owned shops and very close to our daughter and family, including a new baby.

The view from the bedrooms was spectacular with the Rockies so majestic.  The condo is on a corner and the exterior walls are floor to ceiling glass so very bright.  Beauteous sunrises could be seen from the breakfast table.

The modern, chic style  of the furnishings was a nice change from our traditional home on the East coast.  We stayed 39 nights in the condo and Emily cleared out closets and cabinet spaces, so we had plenty of room for storage.  

Emily was super prompt in answering any questions we had.  You will enjoy this lovely condo."
25730584,319510358,2018-09-06,18764567,Adam,Really appreciate Seth's responsiveness.  He accommodated our schedule needs.  The place was great and we'd love to stay again- awesome location in a great neighborhood- easy walk to lots of great food and parks; I had a great morning run; and the space was clean and perfect for our needs.  I highly recommend.
16733876,368706199,2019-01-07,229417532,Karisa,Great little basement apartment. We enjoyed our stay in Denver and would definitely stay here again on our next visit.
74125,36602455,2015-06-29,1582986,Jaebi,"Reading the other reviews accurately depicted what I found upon walking into Joe's spread and here's my piece: If I lived in Denver, I'd totally buy a place like this!

Plenty of space but not a lot of wind. Felt stuffy at times but I was out a lot and it didn't get to hot. There's one bedroom and an open space to crash. I made that space my room because there is art in ever corner or the tools to make some and that's totally how I like to live. There was a keyboard, a drum set, a few reams of books, I felt pretty inspired.

The bathroom was pretty unconventional for me, with it's four-legged tub, not affixed to any wall, a round flight of stairs leading down in the middle of it, a sink that pretty much stands alone on the rail of said staircase and then the toilet somewhere off in the corner. Nothing wrong here, actually pretty cool, esp. if you share the bathroom with a lover(s), each of you can have a little pocket of space to yourself. But again, I'm a New Yorker. Cramped is normal.

I heard the neighbors but didn't see any. They weren't loud, just the normal sounds you'd expect to hear in an apt. building. The best part was Joe, who I never met, but had great communication and set us up to arrive smooth and easy. Hmm, what else.

Yes! The post it mural, which wasn't exactly what I expected but I'm not sure how much I can say about it. Definitely artistic, which again, I loved.

Would definitely stay again!"
19632537,185064745,2017-08-20,137514804,Monica,Great place! No complains. Rose was very accommodating. The place was clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.
4978830,47981672,2015-09-22,40200814,Thomas,"We stayed for a long weekend to attend our son's wedding.  Araceli was very helpful in getting us settled and didn't impose on use during the weekend.
The house and yard are perfect for our young grandchildren with both indoor and outdoor activities.  The house is clean and well maintained and the neighborhood is pretty and quite.  Also, centrally located between Centennial and Downtown, which we were driving between constantly.  
Absolutely, no negative comments.  Great weekend.
Thanks,"
13059132,328292633,2018-09-25,53056453,Shawna,Had an enjoyable time in Denver. House was clean. Location was close to downtown. Anything we needed Mary and Melbe were quick to solve the issue. Thanks again!

8739814,82987671,2016-06-30,29193173,Stanley,Great place! Very quiet neighborhood. Short uber ride to the conference I was attending downtown. The little back yard was nice to sit in at the day's end. And Erik was very accommodating and responsive to all questions. 
22657843,241120667,2018-03-07,170972813,Chyenne,"The location was perfect if you're looking for things to do and see. The Botanical Garden, Nature and Science Museum, VooDoo Donuts, & Ice Cream Riot were all extremely close and must visits when in Denver, and with this location, it took us less than 5 minutes to get to any of these spots!"

665622,229462597,2018-01-23,141311645,Leo,Such a deal and close to everything. It’s not as nice as it looks in the pics but hey it’s AirBnb.
7663335,140536259,2017-03-30,14416501,Jeffrey,"Thoroughly enjoyed John's place and it exceeded my already high expectations from the property details when I booked.  Great location, plenty of space, very nice amenities, and super comfy interior design.  Perfect home away from home to this non-local local to Denver!"
13526515,321033217,2018-09-09,128714448,Joe,"This house was amazing!  Huge, beautiful house with more than enough space for the six of us, in a perfectly safe location with everything needed close by.  We walked to and from Coors Field on a Friday night with no problems.  Good restaurants and ice cream just around the corner but also easy to drive to a limitless number of delicious eats.  Lastly the hosts were INCREDIBLE.  Rob and Tiffany were so nice and communication was a breeze.  We cannot recommend this place enough and can't wait to come back!"
26892290,431798394,2019-04-01,46503514,Garrett,"Great spot! Very stylish and comfy. I loved the area. Very close to local bars and a ton of food in walking distance. Getting downtown was an easy uber ride away. Found my spot in Denver, will be back!"

31962843,536385734,2019-09-26,160229507,John,Place was spotless and very relaxing.  Was all around a very great option for my sister and I to crash for a night and have access to the kitchen without being bothersome to the owners
2467260,360196173,2018-12-19,5506025,Brad And Beth,Decent place with a caring host.
28545094,426681313,2019-03-21,81377511,Alyssa,"First time at hostel and it was a good experience. Clean and stylish interior design. Very nice staff. They make sure to provide every resources available to their guests, which is fantastic. Only downside was the uncomfortable bed, but overall I would recommend!"
26503556,450563370,2019-05-09,68222471,William,"Extremely comfortable bedroom and a spacious, sparkling private bathroom. Can't say enough about the location--walking distance of almost everything you could want out of downtown Colorado. Hosts are friendly and attentive without being intrusive."
21141369,531474984,2019-09-17,283143440,Julian,Really enjoyed chilling out at Brad's loft apprtment before flying home.

13789731,285083326,2018-07-02,14516962,Lonelli,"This place is fine and average.  Easy, keyless check-in.  Plenty of room and outdoor space. It will provide all of the BASIC essentials for travel.
The neighborhood is a bit sketchy - I was harassed by several homeless people. It is two blocks from Cofax which I learned is the worst street in Denver (fun fact - also the longest road in USA).  
AC is not great. I stayed during a 90 degree weekend.  I had to install the bedroom window unit myself. It was a huge hassle.  I had to sleep with the door open because if the AC was running, it made the room dusty/stuffy.  Living room AC barely does anything.  Second living space (enclosed with a curtain - not a wall or door - also has a window unit.
Beds are below average on comfort. Pillows are very bad. 
Kitchen provides BARE MINIMUM. It is not a cooking kitchen, but you can have cereal or make eggs/sandwiches. They do not have a coffee pot. There is a Krueger machine. I walked two minutes (just around the corner) every morning to a local coffee house. 
The cleaning crew will show up EXACTLY at 11am checkout and will not knock. There is no flexibility in checkout. 
The balcony and backyard patio are nice and comfortable. Wi-Fi works great. 
You will definitely hear neighbors, even if they’re being quiet. 
This apartment is not charming, it will not take your breath away, and odds are your own home is significantly nicer. But it’s a clean apartment and does the job. You can walk to most things, though I would suggest walking during daylight hours only or taking a very inexpensive Uber wherever you need to go. 
I’ve stayed at many Air BnB’s. This is the first time I wish I had saved money and stayed at a Holiday Inn instead."
4180622,74951445,2016-05-17,62469738,Vivian,"This was our first time using a Airbnb and it couldn't have been any better! Maureen's casita definitely made me feel right at home when we were far from home. Maureen's casita is cozy, clean, and definitely comfortable! It's near the major highway and roads so it made it easy to travel to the places we wanted to see or eat. I would definitely recommend this place. The pictures you see online are what you get in person! :)

15844892,414752962,2019-02-20,7409515,Marisa,"Wowee! What an awesome place to stay in Denver! This apartment does not disappoint in it’s decor, convenience, and comfort. Daniel was SUPER quick to respond to any questions I had and made sure we had everything we needed and were 100% satisfied. 
Unfortunately, I fell ill at the airport on my way to Denver so I mostly stayed inside the apartment for our trip. I was so grateful to be in Daniel’s cool and cozy apartment and not some hotel.  He had all of the premium pay channels on his Roku and I basically binged watched “My So Called Life” and rested up. Sounds weird, I know, but I was SUPER happy to have comforting nostalgic tv in a beautiful cozy place while getting over the flu.  
The shower is SOOOO nice! And the King size bed was better than our own at home.  Really soft sheets and great pillows. There were plenty of blankets and even a gas fireplace to keep warm.  Seriously, if you get the flu, this is where you want to be! Lol.  
We want to come back in the Summer and will definitely stay here again.  GREAT LOCATION TOO!
Thank you so much Daniel! 
-Marisa and Sam"

3541671,292693576,2018-07-18,62031732,John,It was a very good experience. Loren and Sophia are very friendly people who enjoy having Airbnb guests. The location is ideal with plenty of on-street parking. The home is spotless. It is also close to downtown and two blocks from the bus.

28913988,414150446,2019-02-18,40814985,Chris,Had a great stay at Mike and James's place. Had everything I needed and was a short 5min Uber to downtown. Would stay again!
15193209,176301313,2017-07-30,81174529,James,This is a great location for traveling within Denver or for day trips outside the city. It was very modern and clean.  Check in was on time and thorough and Ryan was very responsive to questions. Very nice to have a garage and not have to worry about street parking. Three of us were traveling and each wanted their own bed - the third bed is a vinyl futon on the bottom level by the garage and it was not very comfortable compared to the other two. 
21684842,302587679,2018-08-05,84775696,Michelle,Ed and Kate offered an amazing space. I would definitely recommend them.
4753876,400643031,2019-01-12,11047928,Rosemarie,Great location in hip RiNO area of Denver with tons of bars and restaurants within walking distance.
14728998,97795990,2016-08-28,1355886,Emily,"Steven's place was a great private suite with a sizable en suite bathroom attached. It has a mini kitchenette at the top of the stairs for tea and coffee. The bedroom, furnishings, and cleanliness were top notch for an Airbnb. The unit is on the top floor which is separate from the owner's sleeping accommodations so it was completely quiet and relaxing. Steven was great with communicating with us and even provided an iron and ironing board for us to use upon our last minute request. The listing appeared to list the unit with a private entrance which wasn't exactly the case. Instead it has a door that opens up onto a weather proofed deck (but not meant for standing on).This wasn't an issue for us for want to alert other guests who may be looking for a separate unit. Also the neighborhood was pretty sketchy. It seems like there are many houses 'in transition'. We walked home from a bar but I definitely questioned how safe it was. Glad to have my boyfriend with me as I would not have felt safe as a woman walking home alone. All in all I would recommend his place for couples looking for a cozy, clean space at a great rate!"

21809847,282906774,2018-06-28,111830309,Debra,"This is by far the best Air BnB space I’ve ever stayed on. This is a duplex set up to accommodate 4 people very comfortably. It was just my husband and i, and we felt completely at home. The place is pristine clean with every possible amenity including stacked Samsung HE washer and dryer. Lovely, thoughtful touches everywhere, such as books, games, note pads and pens. Location, location, location! Front porch overlooks the stadium and downtown. We are antique mall/thrift store people and this place is close to many beautiful antique malls, shopping,  restaurants and museums. They also have a wonderful backyard with nice patio furniture and grill, but the weather didn’t cooperate. Next time, Britt! "
20624536,494102428,2019-07-23,43141244,Andrew,This is the coolest little place in an awesome neighborhood with tons to do.

Their welcome book offered great suggestions on food places and things to do. We did take another guest’s suggestion of getting an eye mask for sleeping since there is a sky light above the bed. Nathan was also helpful with getting us what we needed to clear the snow from our car. The back patio area is also nice since it’s private just for the guests. I will definitely book this place again for my next Denver trip!"

Shelley’s apt is a spotless spacious and high-ceilinged one bedroom w/a gorgeous double vanitied bathroom (for you couples out there). In addition to the space, Shelley’s communication and flexibility was very prompt and insightful from the retrieving of the room key to the car park details. Even though we never met in person, I felt her presence always there like a fairy godmother. With a small outdoor patio, this location and host has the perfect vibes to make your Denver stay the smoothest. You will not be disappointed!"

Some really thoughtful touches and practical additions in the property made it a comfortable stay for all of us. Comfy beds, good size kitchen, some toys and books to keep the kids entertained. The location is hard to beat - loads of cool cafes/restaurants/bars on the doorstep. Parking spot invaluable - the property is an easy drive to lots of slightly further flung attractions. Would definitely recommend this apartment if you’re looking to enjoy the sights and sounds of Denver. Thank you!"
7882412,94392119,2016-08-15,16504408,Hannah,"Annette is very sweet and understanding. She was really helpful by letting us stay very last minute, and also understanding when we had to leave earlier than expected. The place is lovely with the gardens in the back and Tennyson street being so close by! You could walk to the area with amazing vegetarian options and a cute cat cafe! The house is in a lovely neighborhood and also close to the highway. There were only a few things I saw as an inconvenience, one being the kitchen. There is no oven and the attached stove top is not suitable for cooking big meals since we were there for a long period of time. There was also a wasp nest in our door knob that resulted in me and two other people getting stung that her son eventually took care of. The larger home is split into multiple units, the Gables being one, and the lock in between the two units was unlockable  from the other side- so other Airbnb residents almost walked into our place twice, knocking down the mirror that was in front of the door. Thankfully no one was standing there or else we would have gotten hurt. In the end, we stayed there for a while so some things are bound to happen but those were inconveniences for us. We really appreciated Annette accommodating us for so long and remaining understanding the whole time. I believe this place is great for a short term stay. "

24181855,268020312,2018-05-23,35780325,Maurice,"Ian was a great host! He responded almost immediately to all of my messages. There was a couple items that we requested that were not in the place originally (iron/board, portable heater) and Ian brought those over right away. The place was exactly as described and bigger and cleaner than we expected. The place had everything we needed for the duration of our stay (about 5 nights) including plenty of toilet paper, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, towels, etc. My only very minor complaint is that you can hear noise from upstairs (main part of house) quite loudly. However, it didn’t bother us too much as it was only early during the day (we were gone the whole day) and we never heard anything at night. We couldn’t of asked for a better stay and definitely recommend Ian and his place to everyone looking for a clean and great value in Denver. Thanks, Ian!"
1594161,32017764,2015-05-12,579788,Jason,Our intent was to have a place to stay in the area after traveling in the snow.  We arrived at 7pm and got a good night sleep.

7931953,352829103,2018-11-25,30590722,Linda,"My family of four convened for Thanksgiving and we felt right at home. In addition to at home activities of cooking, watching movies, playing cards, we could walk right into the center of downtown Denver on the pedestrian bridges (which have to be experienced to understand what a wonderful public amenity they, and the adjacent park and public spaces, are). There are also local shops and restaurants just around the block if you don't want to walk any farther. The neighborhood felt totally safe and family oriented. Kimberly and Tonya have been very responsive in communicating as we planned our trip, but while we were there, there were absolutely no problems, so aside from check in to pick up a key, it was like the place was ours. This place provides a perfect home base for any visit to Denver."

12276698,163930009,2017-06-25,127021472,Amy,"We took a girl's weekend getaway trip to Denver.  There were four of us and the house was a great accommodation for our party. The house was charming with brick walls and many areas for us to relax.  When traveling with a group it's really nice to have space to have alone time if needed, and the house allowed for that.  

It is located on 8th Avenue which is a busier street.  At nighttime, I could hear louder cars driving by, but that is part of city life. I ran the bathroom fan as white noise, which did help drowned out the sound. 

The house was clean and he provided breakfast items (oatmeal, granola bars, make your own egg McMuffin) and drinks like coffee and tea for us in the morning. Also, there is an iron for clothing, washing machine, and dryer.

Vincent was kind enough to let us check-out a couple hours later, as we had an iFly skydiving event.  We did not want to leave our luggage in the car for long, so it was extremely nice of him to make this accommodation for us.  

Also, he provides you with a parking tag for a lot next door, but we never need to park there as street parking in front of the house was always available.  When you check out be sure to leave the parking tag behind.

Do note the house is the nicest on the block.  He has taken good care of this home.  Surrounding homes are kind of run down.  Use (Hidden by Airbnb) Earth to check out the neighborhood if needed.  This was our first time using Airbnb and was a good experience. I would recommend Vincent's house and would stay here again."

She has made many efforts to ensure you have info & access to everything you need! Pool across the street is great, and the home is in a nice, quieter, friendly neighborhood. Great location close to the up & coming Stapleton area with loads of great eats & drink options!"

25808691,419265842,2019-03-03,2336164,David,"I’m ruined. RUINED. 

After staying in this beautiful home, all other properties I’ve been to since have paled in comparison. The house itself is incredible, truly a jewel box. A few highlights: the kitchen (so nice to use, I imagined myself on Food Network while preparing dinner), the bed (ridiculously comfortable, never wanted to leave), and the shower (am I bathing under a Tahitian waterfall?). And a central sound system to enjoy music while reading or cooking?? Stop it. My friends asked me how I enjoyed my week in Denver — I told them I didn’t know, since I spent any free time at the house rather than exploring. I feel good about my choice.

My only complaint is that Keith politely turned down my request to move in permanently. Oh well ;)"
33970032,496545793,2019-07-27,46484219,Genevieve,"This was a last minute booking that turned out to be way better than expected. Location was great, close walking distance to so many amazing eateries. Communication with Dylan was great and access to the apartment was easy. Highly recommend."

19671778,304068586,2018-08-08,29980465,Karen,Great location for airport departures/arrivals. Quiet neighborhood. Lovely minimalist space. Very clean. Bed and pillows are high quality and very comfortable. Highly recommend staying with Pemba!
12963374,417033513,2019-02-25,12991949,Samuel Alexander,"The apartment was spacious and beautifully kept. It's really just a twenty-minute walk away from downtown, and there are coffeeshops and restaurants nearby. Especially given the price, this is a great place!"
19893591,262978061,2018-05-10,139561,Susan,"This place is in a great location in Denver. It's not in the city center and that works just fine for me. It's a quaint little space, that does the trick. Only things to note are: The bed is quite soft. If you like a harder bed, this one will bum you out. That said, it was still a nice night of sleep. Also, a *real* wine bottle opener is always appreciated, as are tissues around the house. All in all, a fine stay was had. ;)"
20358695,561139715,2019-11-08,231703274,Jacob,Great place to stay. Very clean. Very accommodating. Recommend to anyone that has a group that's staying or even just a family.
9486988,428716813,2019-03-25,105714554,Alexander,Charming and spacious two bedroom two bath. A lot of privacy as the second bedroom has the entire lower level. Great place to stay in the Highlands!
17388640,181963228,2017-08-13,8472696,Caroline,"Eric's place was great, a short ride to downtown but also a 5-10 min walk to some great bars and restaurants in a nice neighborhood. The house was very clean and well equipped with Apple TV, Alexa, and a nice personal bar. Eric was extremely helpful and accommodating - highly recommend a stay here!"
6515185,315031335,2018-08-27,132571961,Peggy,"The space itself is nice and in a good location for being downtown. They suggest taking an Uber from the station or walking. I would take the Uber! There is a homeless shelter along the way. A few times we had to take our bags and walk in the street because the homeless took up the entire sidewalk! If you arrive at a peak hour, expect to pay $10 for Uber from the station. The shower is huge and nice! Definitely a plus to the stay!"
6488535,83684793,2016-07-03,59072631,Tammy,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay.  The condo and the location was fantastic!!!  Brandon and Robert went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful stay.  We aren't sure when we are going to come back to Denver, but we know we would want to stay here again.  We even have told friends about it who are interested. :)"

9169634,543457665,2019-10-07,277757531,Brenden,"This was a nice spot located close to the gothic. Theater.  My brother and I came out to see a musician performing there.  The air bnb was perfect for us.  It fit our style while accommodating in many ways.  We were able to find a lot of food, bars and dispensaries close by.  The back yard is closed off or gated in with easy access which made for a nice place to hang out and get some fresh air.  We were happy with our experience and felt the location and feng shui fit us well.  Really comfortable and friendly place."
23891608,254455047,2018-04-16,143069486,Adam & Bambi,Letisha was quick to answer any questions!  Everything was clean and there was even a grocery store within walking distance!  Would definitely recommend!
756594,39023613,2015-07-20,73238,Anita,"My son and I had a pleasant stay in Ling's & Chris's apartment.  The rooms, which were two bedrooms, living/dining room, and a modern bathroom, were cozy and clean.  They weren't airy and bright since they were in the basement but they were nevertheless quite comfortable.  Our hosts provided us with everything we could need, including a delicious breakfast of yoghurt and scones, a private outdoor parking space, and best of all  laundry facilities right next to our apartment.  I recommend this place heartily.  It's pretty central, the hosts are kind and friendly, and the aparment is a great value for all you are getting."
19116038,555366825,2019-10-27,223178353,Mariah,Courtney was an excellent and responsive host! I really appreciated the recommendations to local places as well!

14962328,221793738,2017-12-27,50553154,Linda,"The apartment was as pictured, spacious, well equipped and in an IDEAL location. Restaurants in easy walking distance and close to shopping at The Highlands and easy access getting around town.  Communication from Sarsha made check in and out very easy. I would enjoy staying here again."
787456,8307863,2013-10-25,4648628,Hannah,"Pamela is a natural hostess.  She is warm, engaging, and just immediately feels like a friend.  I saw less of Brad, but he was friendly nonetheless.  But both were so kind and supportive to come out on a brisk Sunday morning to cheer for me in the Denver marathon with a big banner!  The house is well situated, and I enjoyed running in the three parks nearby, visiting the Botanic Gardens, and gawking at the big historic homes in the neighborhood.  The room turned out not to be as quiet as expected, but Pamela and Brad immediately made an effort to mitigate the noise coming from the kitchen, which helped a lot.  Although all of the other occupants of the house were friendly, I was not prepared for so many people staying there (one weekend we were 9 adults and one toddler).  The bedroom was cozy, and for the most part I enjoyed a private bathroom, although it was used by others on occasion.  As someone who prefers a calm, quiet environment, this was not the ideal situation for me at points despite the kindheartedness of the owners. "
8117043,322616670,2018-09-13,33998795,David,As advertised. Hosts made the whole experience easy. The place was clean and well supplied. Looking forward to staying there again soon.

4638352,103859591,2016-09-24,88313752,Ryanna,"What a way to start out our Colorado adventure! Portia's place was easy to access and felt like home. You get in with a passcode that she provides and there was a lot of parking right in front of the house. The apartment basement also felt very private. Portia and her family were super friendly, but they let us keep to ourselves. 

The decorations were gorgeous and the amenities were great such as a microwave, a TV, and coffee/tea. The place also had some cool features such as bookcases full of awesome books and a mood lit fireplace. Many places were walkable, including Sprouts and Tennyson St (where they have cool restaurants).

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Denver area."
28881584,470010198,2019-06-15,32852440,Dario,Location is very good. Was able to walk to a bunch of places. Had to rent a car for this trip and finding parking after 4 is no joke. I got lucky but you will have to circle a few times to find a spot that might even not be close to the house. Didn’t see anyone else except when I checked in. The house is old which is cool and it has some quirky things about it. The roof balcony is the move tho. Best part for sure
17388640,275313913,2018-06-10,13828308,Lora,"Eric's spot was perfect and worth every penny. Extremely stylish and comfortable apartment in a fantastic location, super easy self check-in, and Eric gave tons of tips.

23891608,305729589,2018-08-11,70823487,Jamie,"Pro: Good location. Grocery right next door, coffee shop 1 block away, restaurants/ pubs and dispensary .5mi away. Private balcony has a nice view. Small but quaint space. 
Con: Host did not communicate when I asked about parking and my car was subsequently towed (I parked in the assigned lot, but host didn’t provide info on which space and I was towed within 1 hour of parking). Host never responded to text/ phone call at number provided in listing and provided on a whiteboard in the apartment. Dwelling is ok. No prerolls/ Starbucks upon arrival. Living room seating is uncomfortable and limited. WiFi didn’t work. Cable is terrible. No sports/ news channels at all. Kitchenware is limited and there were about 3 towels provided.  
Mainly disappointed in the lack of communication and respect from the host. "

Enjoyed the neighborhood - didn’t have a car and used lyft to get around to downtown but with 6 -12 blocks, lots to explore.  "

I didn’t get the pleasure of meeting Sally during my stay but I accidentally left my boots there and she was kind enough to mail them back to California for me! It’s hosts like Sally that make Airbnb fun and work for everyone. Thanks so much for the awesome stay!

The place comes with everything you could possibly need and I loved how Audri styled it. She and her son also surprised me with birthday goodies! and showed me the nearby trails. Looking for things to do? Audri will have a list of local events and suggestions for you. I could go on and on about how great my experience was and how amazing of a host Audri is...I'll just say i loved my airbnb experience. Thanks a million for everything, Audri!"

My friends and I came for a small little reunion and Ian's place was very accommodating for us. Highly recommend! Ian is a cool guy too, very clever with his wifi router names. I don't know about his password choice though, could have been a little bit more related to the router's name hehe. One minor detail would be that the bathroom doors don't really close properly but that's was okay :) thank you for letting us stay, Ian!"

When we arrived she was there with some amazing food she had just made and she graciously shared with us, which we were sooooo thankful for! (our first meal as we had just spent half the day driving and on an airplane). Great vegan cook btw! (;
Her house is extremely spacious and inviting. Our room was perfect for our needs and even had some amenities that she put herself! (Mini shampoo, mints, blow dryer, and iron!) We spent most of our time out and about exploring the city but every time we came back it was like coming home to a friends place! She was always just a message away if we needed anything.

16860906,171025064,2017-07-16,6066289,Erin,"This townhouse is in the cutest neighborhood with a bunch of cute restaurants, breweries, and markets all in walking distance. To top it off, downtown Denver is only a 10 min cab ride away!

The house itself was the perfect size for our party of 8. Everyone had a place to sleep and we fit very comfortably hanging out in the living room/kitchen area.

I communicated with Daniel throughout the lead up to our stay and appreciated his quick responses to my questions. I would be happy to stay with Daniel on any other listings he has and would highly recommend booking this place for your trip to Denver!"

It's conveniently located a few blocks from stores and restaurants, parking was easy, room and bathroom were clean, and the bed was super comfortable."
2104774,50603473,2015-10-12,4628961,Roland,"Cute little apartment that has everything you need to enjoy a great weekend in Denver. Clean, tastefully decorated but the location is what makes this place the best! We are definitely staying with Jeanne and Juve again! We only booked a few hours before we arrived and the whole process was very smooth. Thank you!"
9770909,107475309,2016-10-10,47261308,Damien,"The listing is accurate and if I was in a pinch, I'd stay there again. It was nice to have a TV with Netflix too. "
13454155,173702972,2017-07-23,35495898,Scott,"We cannot recommend this place enough!  Jordan was a pleasure to work with throughout the process and her unit is fantastic!

Jordan was super responsive throughout the booking process, often replying within the hour if not sooner.  She met us at the property on check and even send an email during the week to make sure things were going well.

The house is amazing and in fantastic shape.  Jordan went out of the way to make sure that we felt at home in her home (emptied the fridge, cleaned out a few drawers, etc.).  

Location is great - LoHi area.  We did not have a car on this trip.  Uber from the airport was ~$40.  Most ubers around town were ~$8.  We mainly walked everywhere we went:    Grocery store (15 min walk), liquor store (5 min) multiple restaurants (all within 10 min or less), walk to downtown (20 min).

View from the roof is amazing (honestly this was probably our favorite part).  The summer (July) days were very hot, but the evenings on the roof were great.  Jordan has some nice patio furniture (sectional) as well as a gas fire-pit.  We enjoyed hanging out on the roof almost every night.

The unit did not have cable tv, however all the tvs (front room and bedrooms) are all smart-enabled (either AppleTV or Amazon FireSticks) so we streamed Netflix/Hulu direct from our ipad when we did use the television.

Keypad entry made it easy to come and go (no keys!)

Great unit, highly recommend!"
2119667,10159913,2014-02-03,1120873,Heather,If pass up the opportunity to stay here you'll be missing out! The cottage is simply adorable and so nicely rebuilt. Can you say cast iron claw foot tub?! It was a wonderful respite and I look forward to another opportunity to stay here again. 
2257217,197745116,2017-09-26,97047927,Preston,"This place was a perfect one-night getaway to Denver. Saw a show at the Ogden and this was perfect walking distance.

There’s a code lock on the door to the basement so it was super easy to come and go whenever we wanted. My favorite feature was that it’s 420 friendly. Carissa was very pleasant and clearly puts effort into making the space cute and clean. I definitely recommend this space for anyone returning to Denver or visiting for the first time like us, and we would absolutely stay with Carissa again."

If you have a question or need anything, Nico is at your fingertips. Check in, checkout, and parking are all very convenient. I believe I read one review that stated, “this home is one big screen TV away from being perfect”. It’s obvious that Elena’s home is catered for her guest, because there is definitely now a curved big screen TV. Beds are comfortable and everything is super clean. You should probably just go ahead and book this place, you won’t be disappointed."

21043300,333881643,2018-10-07,53444275,Imani,"David’s Comfy-Contemporary 3 Bedroom - West Highlands is located in a cute neighborhood.  The neighborhood gives you the sense of being safe at home with all the amenities within walking distance.  Unfortunately, the security of staying at this Airbnb changed when we got back to a party taking place in the home we rented.  It’s mind blowing how easily someone else got the access code to enter the home with our personal belongings.  David did answer the phone right away and said he would be out in 30 minutes but failed to show.  He said he didn’t come because he was on the phone with corporate and the person who was throwing the party.  We were left with party goers standing outside as well as one standing in the house waiting while we were trying to make alternative sleeping arrangements for the night.  They caught wind of the fact that we had decided to find accommodations elsewhere, and immediately called, and received approval from the host to stay for the night, in our place, as he “felt bad” that they had travelled two and a half hours This entire process took over a hour and a half.  Our food which we brought back to eat was ruined.  If you value your sense of security you may want to stay some where else."
915016,47659414,2015-09-21,17689918,Eric,"The accommodations were exactly as advertised. Tim and Cindy provided a list of restaurants in the Capitol Hill area, which was very helpful for our first visit to Denver. BCycle has a few locations within a few blocks for easy access to other parts of the city, or there's always Uber too. We didn't get to meet Tim and Cindy in person, but we appreciate all of their communication leading up to and including our stay, and we really appreciate them letting us stay with them!"

24644409,276781585,2018-06-14,195097064,Bernie,Cruz is a great host. Place is immaculately clean and right in the heart of a cool hip neighborhood. Hard to find a place to stay in for that price in that location of Denver. I had relatives staying at nearby hotels for $250+ a night.

My husband and I and my daughter and son-in-law stayed for a week while visiting family and hanging out in the mountains and downtown Denver. The place is very clean and the well equipped kitchen afforded us to make meals if we didn't feel like going out.
It's located near everything and was an $8 Uber ride to downtown Denver. City Park is a very short walk down the street and my daughter worked out and ran there every morning. Great bars and restaurants surround the neighborhood which had beautiful homes throughout the area. Ryan even had a cute little backyard with a picnic table for use. We would definitely recommend Ryan's place to stay!!!! Perfect!!

18891531,174095880,2017-07-24,22336228,Katy,This is a great spot in Denver!  Close to many restaurants and also pretty close to downtown. We had everything we could possibly need. This place was perfect. 
11338921,80650750,2016-06-19,55779784,Jim,Place was great. Close to everything. Parking provided.  Dawn was extremely responsive and provided a great information packet prior to arrival. We had a great time  and would definitely want to stay here again.
5966633,178124016,2017-08-04,143745326,Rene,"This is exactly what you hope for when you think of a B&B. Exceeds expectations. Extremely clean, beautiful carriage house, stocked kitchen with the necessities, Washer and dryer, beautiful shower with two showerheads, comfortable bed, gorgeous living room, great location. The hostess is extremely friendly and accommodating. I cannot recommend this place enough."
18153418,304527625,2018-08-09,4126626,Kyle,great price and location. everything was clean and the hosts were all very friendly! 
665622,30287386,2015-04-20,26383684,Jeffrey,This was a great place to stay. Lovely neighborhood with lots of cool places close by. Becky was a very responsive host that offered input for things to do in the area. I would definitely stay here again.
29281503,403847782,2019-01-21,27040131,Haley,I would highly recommend Barbara’s place. The apartment was spotless and cozy. The king size bed was one of the comfiest we had ever slept in and such a treat after a long weekend of skiing. Barbara’s hospitality and communication was above and beyond and much appreciated. We went a couple of blocks over and had a lovely meal at Palizo off of S Pearl and we were pleasantly surprised to see a lively strip of restaurants and bars for a Sunday evening. Would have loved to stay longer and explore the area surrounding Barbara’s place because the neighborhood was just lovely. We hope to visit again one day!

3150813,178985602,2017-08-06,12483556,Cale,"Mark's home is incredible - the pictures don't do it justice. We hosted a large group dinner one night, and the massive kitchen really made things easy. We also enjoyed the incredible speaker system. Mark was easy to communicate with before and after booking, and he was always available via text during our stay. I would definitely recommend this place for any larger groups who are looking for somewhere special to stay in Denver. "
20198585,468976603,2019-06-13,197647037,Susan,"Very nice, would definitely stay there again."
11690656,166034663,2017-07-02,122248728,Chrystal,"All I could say is we LOVED it , it was amazing it's walking distance to everything and it was an awesome house we are most deff staying at Cassie's again when we go back . And her cats are super awesome my husband fell in love with them . I deff recommend. "

39405,121509212,2016-12-17,26733675,Melissa,"Jeny and Gio's place was absolutely incredible. It has everything you might want or need - coffee and coffeemaker and tea, instant oatmeal, pop and other beverages in the fridge, and ice in the freezer. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and has a TV with Netflix/Hulu/Amazon mounted right at the foot of the bed! The cottage itself was cozy and adorable, with just the right amount of space for two people. It got to 0 degrees outside but we were never cold between the heater and the fluffy blankets and pillows. The hot tub is super easy to use and so nice on a cold night, and street parking is convenient and easy to find. It's super easy to Uber to points of interest in the city - we loved the art museum. We had an amazing time and can't wait to be back!"
24689489,419307655,2019-03-03,95765719,David Dashifen,"This place is a gem.  The cost is great, the hosts are wonderful, and if you're looking for a place near to Iliff or the University of Denver, this one's perfect."

24202778,294978232,2018-07-22,32580827,Leah,"The apartment itself was clean and nice, but we were looking forward to some of the amenities (pool in particular) that were not available. (They’re not open yet, but claim to be useable). Some of the photos in the listing were accurate. Lastly, check out was a bit confusing and instructions weren’t clear. Checkout was listed at 10am, yet the office wasn’t open until noon and no one was there to receive the key from us.
"
30508451,546648698,2019-10-13,185566429,Hailee,"This adorable apartment was the perfect size for us! 
We checked in pretty late and Anne was sweet enough to go turn on the front light for us before our easy check in with her lock box. 
We got in and we’re amazingly shocked at how clean and thoughtful the setup was . 
It was in walking distance to so many cute food/ coffee/ and other local shops.
We absolutely loved it and can not wait to come back !"
26165764,300683722,2018-08-02,172564907,Gerilyn,Katia was a great host! The area is very open and spacious. I stayed for a couple of days and it was exactly what I needed. Also a great location! I so recommend staying here.

3810191,19239688,2014-09-08,11559304,Richard,"Cathy was very friendly and welcoming and she got us clear information about the location well ahead of time. She made us feel welcome into her home. This is a charming little bungalow, and the location was great. Very quiet location. Everything you could want was right there, and the rest of Denver seemed to always be 10 minutes away. "
23609578,539603765,2019-10-01,266281173,Amanda,10/10 recommended! Clean and stylish environment. Great location!  All you need for a weekend getaway!
22376468,313578984,2018-08-25,65750640,David,"Cheri is an amazing host!  It's no wonder so many guests have said so.  We felt right at home with her and would definitely return for another stay.  Also, a wonderful location! Very ""walkable"" to the downtown area."
7790834,136136910,2017-03-08,42779147,Charlie,Everything about the listing was exactly as Samantha described it! The bed and the fold out couch were extremely comfortable and Samantha's recommendations for thing to do in the area are great. I would absolutely stay again!
18449124,452105078,2019-05-12,73630131,Christina,Cute house! Great host. The house itself can be difficult to find for Uber or Lyft but otherwise a great stay.
23880394,311604087,2018-08-21,171162637,Madison,This place was very cute and clean. The rooftop access is great and there is plenty of space for a handful of people. Perfect for a group of friends! David was awesome at communicating. Would definitely stay here again.

26158183,457278984,2019-05-23,191944214,Jenny,Awesome place! Great restaurants/coffee shop that is walking distance. Close to downtown & hiking spots. Amazing roof top views & dedicated parking space.
36378454,553266031,2019-10-23,174266764,Tammy,I’m so glad we stayed here instead of hotel.  Adorable neighborhood. Garage parking.  Felt safe.  Easy drive to Denver and other tourist attractions.
11945010,321963926,2018-09-11,133186877,Colin,Wonderful apartment in the back of a beautiful home. Being away from the street made for a quiet and calm space—perfect place to chill after exploring Denver all day. Would absolutely stay here again!! (Bonus points for the rad cow wallpaper in the bathroom.)
19812592,317881419,2018-09-02,191910740,Jacob,"Very clean, great experience, comfortable bed, hot shower, everyone there was very polite"
11192056,149194458,2017-05-03,41622726,Dan,"Colfax is one of the main arterial roads in and out of Denver proper, with this apartment overlooking Colfax, accessed on Marion. 

Kingas apartment is within a maybe 6 unit block. My car was parked between this block entrance and a bar behind it. An initial impression from the shared entrance staircase in terms of decor was quickly washed away by the superb apartment in terms of location, light  and the pictures truly reflect the place. Each bedroom and the bathroom had its own sliding door. The place was clean and to a good standard. The apartment sits above Kingas own bar and we did have a bad nights sleep on our first night (Friday) with noise from both bars and passers by throughout the night; this settled the following 3 nights. "
4504068,181449076,2017-08-12,100661195,Pouya,"David and Virginia were amazing! I would 100% stay here again in a heart beat. My fiancé, a friend, and I were all passing through Denver and we were lucky to stay here. The house was very cozy and decorated with all kinds of trinkets that David and Virginia have collected in their travels. There were 2 bedrooms with a shared bathroom downstairs that suited us perfectly. David have a nice breakfast of cereal, bagels, and toast out for us in the morning - along with coffee and orange juice. All my interactions with them when we finally met were so pleasant, and they shared with us many stories of their travels. They had so many interesting things to say! In short, I loved it. You should definitely stay here if you’re ever passing through Denver!"
16857174,238715652,2018-02-26,6256311,Katie,"Good location, easy access."
17530389,533509906,2019-09-21,286976386,Susan,A great place to stay in Colorado. You'll be in Denver and close to various activities.
27868894,472480172,2019-06-19,208348259,Allie,"Exactly as described and their dog Maxie was very sweet and loved to cuddle us! Super clean, roomy, and in a good location. Would definitely recommend and stay again if ever in Denver!"
19113386,469515574,2019-06-14,1922948,George,Loved it - great area! Would go back.
12008338,175756701,2017-07-29,132772806,Jessica,"Was centrally located to any travel destination in Denver or surrounding areas. Close to downtown for food and outdoor activities. Nice, clean and exactly what we were looking for! Would stay here again!"
22942295,251914799,2018-04-08,176397957,Amanda,"Great place, convenient location to restaurants, shops & downtown. Nice backyard, clean. Only issue was tv, needed a laptop. Would definitely stay again!"
13081152,92729639,2016-08-09,74301413,Collin,"Booking with Mitch is a no brainier, half the price of a hotel with double the comfort and amenities. Mitch is a wonderful person and so is his sweetheart girlfriend. This was our first true experience with AirBnB and we were more than satisfied, and will use the services again. Mitchell's house is modern and in a hip part of town, while being easily accessible to the rest of Denver and surrounding area. Our last night there my girlfriend and I were challenged to a round of Mario Kart by Mitch and his Girlfriend and it was a blast! Would strongly recommended staying with Mitch! 

P.S. If you are thinking of renting a car, look into the car2go car sharing service in Denver. It's is a neat and cost-saving alternative to renting a car with a major company. 

Happy travels!! "
27753904,524788773,2019-09-06,54512754,Lindsey,"We had a great time!  The space was clean and quiet, and we really enjoyed being able to relax in their backyard, especially after a long day of travelling."
16273597,441151653,2019-04-21,108621131,Amy,"Brett’s place was the perfect place to stay after a night out in Denver. Easy check-in, everything was clean, and the neighborhood was great!"
4236002,111306322,2016-10-30,90270233,Julie,Hosts were fantastic! Neighborhood great! 
19141160,167156762,2017-07-05,73838057,Autumn,Nice location and and nice little apartment/ studio 
21139434,342369040,2018-10-28,139254779,Kelly,"Michael was a great host. He was very responsive and was quick to get us everything we needed even though we scheduled only a couple of days before our trip! The carriage house is in a GREAT location. Very close to the zoo and botanic gardens. It's a very cheap uber to get to 16th street. His place is stylish and well put together, and has extra toothbrushes, soap and anything we could have possibly needed. There are lots of extra towels, pillows, and linens for guests to use. I also can not understate the value of having a two-car garage to use beneath the carriage house. Parking is normally a nightmare in that area, so having a dedicated place to park our cars was absolutely crucial to making our stay top-notch. I would without a doubt stay in the carriage house again. We had an amazing time!"
26897102,502416957,2019-08-04,58717785,Matthew,Rebecca’s place is wonderful. It’s in a perfect location with easy access to a bunch of great bars and restaurants. The room is clean and quiet with a comfy bed and a nice bathroom. Rebecca was very sweet and great with communication.
27953051,424436223,2019-03-16,8478989,Charles,"Amazing house. Old on the outside with the history kept intact on the inside, but update. The hosts live in the other units. The hospitality is nice, however, borders on overbearing. Other than that, I will always check if this place is available when I visitor Denver."
10161676,195754601,2017-09-20,1541302,Drew,I've rented several places across the US from Airbnb and Nancy's place is hands down AMAZING. We have a two year old and a need to cook our own food. Beds were comfy and clean. The neighborhood was friendly. I can't think of a single thing she could improve on.
12068403,528804336,2019-09-13,60266428,Linda,"We stayed at Jessica’s place while attending the Cards/Rockies game. It was very walkable to the stadium and great restaurants along the way. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO CLIMB ALOT OF STAIRS. We are senior citizens and the stairs were not a problem but if you have any problem with stairs I would not recommend. We felt very safe there although there are homeless people just around the corner. Lots of space in the condo. All amenities that you would expect were provided. The courtyard area was so relaxing, a true find in downtown Denver. We ate at Ignite a few blocks down on their rooftop and I would definitely recommend it. The Lobby located under the condo closes at 6pm so did not eat there but the bottomless mimosas and brunch were enjoyed by quite a few people."
33875293,498374130,2019-07-29,431032,Adi,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was clean, well-laid out and close to so many  great neighborhoods and places of interest. We would definitely stay there again!"
11945010,426360718,2019-03-20,7084390,Jocelyn,"This unit is in a wonderful neighborhood - walkable to a grocery store and a beautiful, historic area!  The design of the apartment is both spacious and cozy with a fluffy bed and big, open kitchen!  Check in is easy and Josh responds quickly to messages."
11691732,127737407,2017-01-20,78128115,Heidi,"Fantastic, spacious and super clean basement suite! Kelly was super responsive and accommodating of all of our questions and early rising time. Gorgeous, tranquil home in an awesome neighborhood just a short walk or drive to all that Cherry Creek has to offer.  Beautiful decor. Highly recommend."
36420083,559177268,2019-11-03,48622697,Adam,Staying at Dean’s house was absolutely great. I stayed here for about 3 months total. Everyone has their own space to themselves but also the common areas to hang out in. Things were always kept very neat and tidy and if you ever needed anything Dean was there to help out. His dog Tango is a little shy but is awesome.
23609578,464069234,2019-06-04,244598348,HArry,"The place was beautiful. At first we weren’t sure what to expect with it being a guest house, but it was amazing. Very private, beautiful house. It had everything we needed and more. Location was very convenient."
18141501,170504462,2017-07-15,126416807,Jarrette,"Tim was very quick to respond and willing to work with us to get checked in early. 
The space is small but all you need for a weekend get away. 
Everything was clean and neat.
Tim surprised us with fresh fruit and bagels upon check in which was a great touch. 
No AC which did get a little warm, would have been nice to have a window unit or more fans. 
Great location, felt safe the whole time and we were minutes away from highways and downtown Denver. 
Perfect place for a minimalist and for a short weekend get away. "
15084761,368678936,2019-01-07,195043696,Ben,Amadeo’s cozy home accommodated my girlfriend and me perfectly for a weekend in Denver. Highly recommend!
11127739,226103807,2018-01-08,28517954,Matt,"Eric’s place was phonomenal! Great location, his response time was on point as well as a very clean and welcoming space! I will be booking with Eric again soon!"
1733052,147248216,2017-04-25,5121390,Lori,"Second time to stay at Jason's place and it never disappoints. Clean, quiet, comfortable and nice drinks and snacks. Having the extra twin bed is handy for traveling with a teenager. Plus restaurants just around the corner that stay open late. "
33907546,504449230,2019-08-07,95382592,Don,"Check-in was very easy and the rooms were very clean! The location was fantastic, only 15 minutes away from downtown."
19449063,256477684,2018-04-22,90936388,Barb,"Ashley is amazing as a host.   We had a terrible situation (our host cancelled on us while we were enroute to  Denver)....airbnb luckily was able to find us a house in record breaking time and we luckily were able to stay at Ashley's house.  She was incredibly gracious and responsive, the house was terrific and the location was perfect.   What could have been a horrible situation ended up being a wonderful weekend.  Thank you, Ashley!!!"
20454442,309795332,2018-08-18,149478579,Samantha,Affordable spot in a quiet neighborhood with convenient 420 friendliness for out of towners. Easy access to downtown Denver and Red Rocks. 
24042749,511716580,2019-08-17,278356721,Oscar,"Just what I was looking for. Self check in, quiet, comfortable, and great ADJUSTABLE QUEEN BED. Choose your setting and have a great sleep."
21409655,229451884,2018-01-23,98632456,Kristin,We really loved how cozy our room was. The location was also super convenient to walk to the bus. Diana was extremely helpful with tips about places to visit. I always think it is a bonus as well when hosts have keyless entry to their homes like Diana did!
24247962,446112314,2019-04-30,61467415,Matt,"Nice and clean.  Perfect for 2 people.     Right in my favorite area of Denver and walking distance to great restaurants and bars.  Check in was easy. The lights were kind of a pain (lamps that don’t seem to be tied to the light switches so you have to manually turn on and off). Other than that, very nice place and I’d stay there again."
11120331,99738979,2016-09-05,6793802,Marion,"Jessica welcomed us into her home personally. It was clean, well supplied and quaint. There was some construction happening upstairs with a new bathroom being installed and not quite done yet, so there was some a bit of dust and renovation supply but nothing disruptive. The neighborhood is a close drive to downtown and to 70, though the immediate neighborhood is a little bit rough around the edges."
10266757,307130321,2018-08-13,163204604,Jennifer,"Great place, close to things to do, safe area. "
23457396,284627636,2018-07-01,118542510,Alex,Great location close to the zoo and Nature and science museum.
34570890,556517901,2019-10-29,245900044,Raquel,"Patty was such a great host! She had awesome recommendations! It snowed while out in Colorado and they did an awesome job by keeping us updated on the conditions and making sure the walkway was salted, even cleaned our car for us! Only thing was it was a little chilly at night but she made it clear to let her know and she will adjust the temperatures for you. Thank you so much Patty for an awesome experience."
8372001,273614431,2018-06-06,56834498,Kayla,"Emma and her husband were extremely kind and friendly, I felt right at home! There was plenty of parking out front for my rental car, and getting in & out of the city was a breeze. I would definitely stay with them again."
21151336,355759999,2018-12-05,4843745,Frank & Nicole,"I can't rave enough about how much I enjoyed staying at Hanna's apartment. It was styled beautifully with fresh plants and flowers everywhere. There were plenty of books and magazines to read and games to play. The concert that I was attending in Denver had to be postponed and I was glad that Hannah was so accommodating and allowed me to change dates! She was very quick to respond to any message I sent and was readily available if there was an issue, as her family lives upstairs. There were so many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment! My favorites were the vintage postcards, the ""house nightcap"", and chocolates on the nightstand. The only downside was that I only stayed for one night. Restaurants and shops are right down the block, parking was easy to find on the street, and the location seemed very safe and friendly. I was already daydreaming about coming back as I drove home!"
56185,305728368,2018-08-11,10454911,Tanya,"Kate's place is amazing; it's certainly the best airbnb I've stayed in. Her house is impeccably decorated and there are thoughtful touches everywhere--from a basket of toiletries from her previous trips (shampoos, lotions, etc.), to an abundance of pillows and blankets and seating space, it was comfort at every corner. We came in August and Kate's garden was in full bloom. Kate generously let us eat from the garden, so we ate fresh berries, tomatoes, peaches, and cucumbers every day! It was a real treat, especially for my toddler who loved to eat blackberries for breakfast. Kate's style is also evident throughout the house; if I could hire her as an interior decorator, I would. If you're looking for somewhere comfy and cozy, with every amenity you could want (including the best luxurious bathtub in the basement), look no further! I would definitely stay here again next time we're in Denver."
4263714,316690731,2018-08-31,71136797,Chaithanya,"LOved the location, Old house but ok for a night stay"

The flat was in walking distance to most everything and will certainly be the first place we look to book when returning to Denver.

15174189,329365773,2018-09-28,43277861,Caitlin,"Pamela’s place was perfect, we got a late flight into Denver which lucky for us was not a problem as Pamela had a lockbox out front. She was quick to respond to any questions we had and provide instructions. Her place was lovely and our room and bathroom were perfect for the two of us.  Parking was easy, since we got in so late we parked on the street and had no issues. Our room was super cute and comfortable (loved the mini fridge and amenities!) all in all, Pamela’s place had everything we needed and we couldn’t thank Pamela enough for having us! We will be back!!"

27754700,563999020,2019-11-14,69441100,Marjorie,"My friend Nancy and I came to Denver and stayed at Tims place for 3 nights.  When we arrived it was 19 degrees. With both thought that we would be sitting with a cup of tea to warm up while the house heated up. We arrived to find the heat was already on and the house was warm. What a wonderful surprise. We are both from San Francisco and love character in homes and this one fit us perfectly. Was just what the listing advertised. There is a Safeway 2 blocks away, with a Starbucks. This is a short walk from the rental and and can see all the different homes. I especially like it when they have the front open and you can see in. Be aware there are a lot one way streets and the signage for highways is terrible. They also charge you to park at Whole Foods and the Mall. This was crazy for us. We did make it to the Garden of the Gods and highly recommend it, no admission charge. Pikes Peak was closed due to weather. When I come back to Denver I will try and stay here. It's perfect for those who don't want modern and clean lines. Character through out.  Highly recommend this place for any time of year.  Thanks again Tim for sharing your home with us.      Margie and Nancy"

The pictures do not do the place justice. My boyfriend compared the place to a suite at The W. The unit is impeccable, clean, modern and has everything that one may need. It exceeded our expectations. As a bonus, it is across the street from a beautiful park with a lake. Susan is incredibly attentive and responsive and just overall pleasant. I recommend this listing to anyone staying in Denver! Thank you! We loved it!"

Clean, stylish, and up to date room in a new subdivision. About 15 minutes from the airport. It’s worth noting that there’s no driveway- street parking only. Check in was easy, but I had to text the host for instructions."

The house was tidy, bed clean and  the pup was very friendly but not intrusive. Rachael and Andrew were friendly and sociable whenever we saw each other and made sure I had my privacy.  This place was ideal, about $7 dollar Uber ride to anywhere . The airport ride was a little more about $25 bucks. She is 420 friendly as you can get!! I will be back."

Has a parking space which is great, but there are also more behind from an overflow parking lot for a grocery store. Comfy, quiet room in the basement. Seems like it had been redone fairly recently. The hosts were very helpful. The heated floor had an issue, but they helped as soon as I mentioned it. I’d guess they’ll have that repaired soon for the next guests, since an awesome little feature!

I very much appreciated her quick responses to my questions. The price was well worth the money.  I recommend you check out Laura’s AirbNb if you are ever in the Denver area ⛰"
22231253,437996180,2019-04-15,20710056,Matt,"Really great place in an awesome neighborhood for a great price. Comfortable and decorated nicely so it felt like a home and not a guest house. Quiet street, free parking, and safe area. I’m originally from Denver and in case it’s not clear, this location is truly great for any kind of visit, business or tourism. It’s just a quick drive right to all the stadiums, convention center, and just about anything worth doing or seeing in the city.

Mattresses were not for me, they were like a thin version of a memory foam. Just a heads up."

Instead, we were pleasantly surprised at Ryan's. There was prompt communication even though we were in/out of service areas, and he was there to greet us when we arrived. Towels were already in the room and everything was clean (and nicely decorated).  We parked  nearby and there was a parking permit available that we didn't need to use. We walked to everywhere we needed to go and the neighborhood is cute. We felt safe and clean at Ryan's and I highly recommend."

1143676,4892175,2013-05-31,4411601,Kim,"I stayed at Nan's beautiful ""Butterfly House"" for three weeks while conducting family business in Denver.  The home is new construction with lots of light, beautiful floor to ceiling windows,  chic interior décor, all new appliances, flat-screen TV, free internet access, wonderful closet space, and a fabulous, spacious deck.  Situated right across the street from City Park and the Denver Zoo, ""Butterfly House"" is located a short drive to the Botanic Gardens, fun restaurants, downtown, and Cherry Creek.  There is also a beautiful, shaded yard with seating and a great view of the park and off-street parking behind the gated entry.

Nan was an excellent hostess--providing some ""starter items"" in the kitchen and bath and a lovely bouquet of welcome flowers.  I was travelling with a small dog, and Nan was a gracious hostess to him, too--volunteering to let him out when I had to be away for a longer time than usual.  Nan lives in the adjacent home and was VERY responsive to any request.

Butterfly House is a perfect place for a long stay for business or pleasure, and I will definitely return on future trips to Denver.

2139342,23062053,2014-11-22,15062489,Rachel,"Jeffrey's home is just as beautiful and comfortable as described and exhibited in the photos.  The fire place was an absolutely lovely piece of home to have on a few frigid Denver days.  Jeffrey goes above and beyond over and over.  For example, it snowed while we were there and he had the walk shoveled first thing in the morning even prior to us leaving the house at 8am.  The fridge was stocked with a few little welcome treats and the kitchen fully and beautifully supplied with all cooking items one could want.  The fabulous soaps, lotions, toiletry items (in case you forgot anything) and plush towels all made this home a stunning retreat.  I loved walking around in the neighborhood in the afternoons as well.  I would return again and again!!!"

As first time Airbnb users, we didn’t know what to expect. Ashley was great about answering all of our questions and clarifying anything we were confused about.

The house itself was perfect for our large group (10 people), and exceeded our expectations."

One caveat: we were in town during a 100-degree streak, so if you're sensitive to the heat, just a warning that there is no AC, only fans, which probably isn't a problem during 99% of the year, but it made our trip a hot one."

Thankfully Ria pointed out the coffee living room coffee table that doubles as a puzzle making table. We pulled out the puzzle tray, put down our phones and enjoyed making a puzzle. The rain shower was luxurious. AC worked surprisingly  great for an old home. No need to cook in this location with all the delicious restaurants to choose from just blocks away. I loved morning coffee and pastry on the shaded patio at Downpours and roof top happy hour at Shells and Sauce. Highly recommend taking advantage of the free passes to the botanic  gardens.  Gretchen and Jim were incredible helpful with things to do and amazing response time to boot.
Highly recommend  this place. We will be back!"

We wanted to stay in Denver for a couple nights before we began our camping/hiking road trip through the four corners and they were very informative about scenic areas to camp in.   Additionally, the place was immaculate! Very clean and well decorated, it was nice to sit out on their patio (420 friendly), and the bed was super comfortable!  Finally, their house is within walking distance of some great restaurants, always a perk!"

I couldn't have been more pleased with my stay. Ashley is an incredibly generous and welcoming host, and her cat, Magic, is very warm and affectionate. The backyard at the house is huge and is great for having friends over, and Ashley herself does a great job of including her roommates in social activities to make them feel welcome. I would highly recommend staying here for any length of time."

20917414,297319529,2018-07-27,17119850,Elodie,"I stayed in this house for a week long business trip. The house was a very relaxing place to come to each night after a busy day at the convention center. The house has everything you need, is very quiet in a residential neighborhood. I took an Uber to downtown each day which was about 10-15 mins max. I loved staying here! "

The place was clean and spacious, though it should be noted that her bedroom will remain locked during your stay. The location is great, walking distance to downtown and many great spots to eat and drink.

28028772,479351738,2019-06-30,3393840,Luke,"Quick drive to anywhere we wanted to go. Some great touches in the house, it’s clear Seth took the care to provide a personality and flair to the space. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy and the home doesn’t look like much from the outside but the inside is nice."
29261204,509557626,2019-08-14,49144139,Barbara,"We really enjoyed our short time in your apartment. It couldn't have been more perfect for us, from the apartment it's self to the location. When we are back in Denver, we will check if your apartment is available first, we highly recommend Vince's place!"
14787426,337297906,2018-10-15,210740685,Heather,I was pleasantly surprised that the layout was a little more spacious than I'd anticipated based on the photos. Super walkable to a great variety of restaurants and the Broncos stadium and easy access to the highways for our day trips to the mountains. The only thing I'd say was a slight drawback was the low ceiling between the bedroom and living area. My husband and I are both tall (6'0 and 6'2) so there was a lot of ducking. But that was super minor and I'd definitely stay there again!
29261204,490450726,2019-07-18,24921146,Terry,Great apartment. Great location close to Union Station. Thoughtful and responsive host.

23006749,320370655,2018-09-08,53810297,Abbey,"Matt was very welcoming and informative about all his space has to offer. The house is extremely comfortable! It was also very easy to cook and clean up. All in all it was the perfect space to come back to after exploring Denver, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere central and private."
21368214,249067744,2018-04-01,171030139,Sarunya,"Design: The design of the whole townhouse, including kitchen, bathroom, door trim, baseboard, etc. is urban modern which is our design style so we loved it.  When you walk in, the place feels super clean (and it is).  It is well decorated and is also well stocked (utensils, hot chocolate, coffee, pancake mix, etc.).  The rooftop is nice and would be a good place to hang out on a nice day.  Just some advisories: 1) There are a number of steps to climb (from the front door up to the living room up to the bedroom and up to the roof, if you go there).  We didn't mind the steps but if you are someone who does, it may be a consideration point.  2) The garage is small.  It's big enough for a mid-size car or smaller but anything bigger than mid-size does not fit.  

Location: The location is great - situated just Northwest of downtown Denver, which makes it easy to get around.  The neighborhood has a coffee shop, wine shop, pub, salon, and restaurant within a convenient walking distance.  There is a supermarket a few blocks away which also is convenient.  

Inquiry Response: Pretty quick, usually within an hour or two.

Overall it was a great stay and we would stay again."
1189999,78637171,2016-06-08,51363854,Rebecca,"Mike was there when we arrived and introduced us to Rachel and Shy. We had plans to go for dinner with family, and they gave us some guidance about the places within walking distance. We had a lovely dinner and an enjoyable evening.
We loved  Mike and Rachel's home, the apartment we stayed in was lovely and had everything we could have asked for to make our stay enjoyable. The space in the apartment was ideal for our family and we really appreciated comfortable beds and bedding. We were also pleased with the location of this property. It was quite close to everywhere we had planned to go and certainly reasonably priced! We will certainly return to Mike's for our next trip to Denver! Thanks, Mike for the hospitality!"
22407753,273003851,2018-06-04,75701,Richard,"This is a beautiful space in a gorgeous and safe neighborhood.  The rain shower, the huge TV and the comfortable bed are definable top of the line.  It appears that the host is in the process of adding full kitchen, which will make this space even better.  If your'e looking to do light cooking and eat in this might not work for you. This space is in the basement which has very easy access and also has a shared utility room which definitely a plus.  If you are distracted by a living space above you this might be something to consider.  "
6925791,253205670,2018-04-13,179666531,Carter,"Really enjoyed my stay at Robert's AirBNB.  Before I got into town, Robert provided a great detail showcasing local attractions.  Robert makes himself available to his guests whenever you need anything, while still respecting your privacy.  I had no issues with parking, and the price point for this spot is great.  Definitely recommend staying here if you are stopping in Denver and need a nice, quaint place to stay."
3395085,321120972,2018-09-09,102532022,Taylor,Jenni is an amazing host and we had a great time staying with her! We brought a dog with us and she let him hang out with her while we were out. Her house is super cute and is a quick drive to downtown and next to a nice park with a lake. I would definitely stay with her again!

We used it when exploring all the different areas of Denver and it is about 10/15 minute Uber to anywhere you want to go once you get there from the airport. He was super communicative, offered fantastic advice on where  to go, where to eat, and reassured some of the choices for events  to do that we made. I would stay here not only for the place, but for the advice if it is your first go around. Happily would stay here again next time in Denver."

Amenities and space are simple, functional, and tastefully just-right - right down to the intriguing selection of books on the shelf.

They even brought it to our rooms so we could be lazy and stay warm inside. The place felt cozy yet very spacious with plenty of sleeping space and bedding. The kitchen is large and fully equipt if you decide to cook. Parking on the street wasn't a problem there's plenty of space right in front of the building. And the best part was the keycode locks so you don't have to worry about losing the keys! We had such and amazing trip because of Kingas Place! We will def be booking with Kinga again soon!

I would definitely recommend. "
7912052,488816645,2019-07-15,270591696,Tiger,"I can’t emphasise enough how much we enjoyed our stay here. Hiroko was so sweet, friendly, and hospitable and went to amazing lengths to make us feel at home. She made us sandwiches and pastries in addition to providing a whole bunch of cereals, drinks, and snacks. She really thought of everything. Our space was much larger than we anticipated and was a great base from which to explore Denver."
22533206,293649387,2018-07-20,129784432,Tyrin,"Nice place in the best ideal location in Denver, if you are involved with exploring downtown. "

23557779,464023227,2019-06-04,128701730,Andrew,"Great location with a very stylish yet homey feel. Clean and organized. Equipped with everything you would need in an airbnb, this property is well managed and Tim did a great job getting back to us very quickly when we had a question."
31879906,416958117,2019-02-25,240011390,Amber,Gorgeous house in a great location. Such beautiful decor and texture and SO clean. Will definitely book my stays in Denver around the availability of this house.

3882739,19003476,2014-09-04,20316930,Elizabeth,The space was great and in a very convenient part of town. Nick was very informative and welcoming. Over all a wonderful experience and I would recommend Nick's Airbnb.
14833679,111917529,2016-11-02,42837603,Kyle,nice place just a few mins walk from downtown. Hosts seem like great guys and had a lot of fun in town .
6488535,113022334,2016-11-09,99689077,Tyler,"Brandon and Robert were awesome hosts! From the minute I booked the air bnb, until the day we left these guys were super helpful. They were extremely accommodating when my girlfriend and I landed before check in letting us come by early to drop our bags off. The location was perfect. Super quiet but only a few short blocks to south broadway street which has some awesome restaurants, stores and dispensaries. Their apartment has a very cosy feel to it, photos and discriptions don't do it justice. We enjoyed hanging out there after a long day exploring. This was our first time using air bnb and couldn't be any happier. We will be booking again next time we come out. Much love from Philadelphia! "
31490273,512882845,2019-08-18,230421229,Tyler,Highly recommend. Dustin is a great host and his place is awesome.

16087125,431363900,2019-03-31,47921057,Ashley,Loved Julie's place.  Great location and an adorable home.  Julie was so quick to respond to any questions and was so nice and helpful.  Would recommend this place to anyone.
4753876,60672589,2016-01-25,55565938,Janella,This was a cute little loft right near everything I needed.  It was great because I didn't have to drive anywhere. I love the industrial look in the loft!
26591391,478310735,2019-06-29,204442554,Ellena,"It’s a wonderful house, much bigger than it appears in the pictures. My favourite part was the garden, where I spent most of my time. Lauris was great at communicating with us.
Had a bit of WiFi trouble but quickly resolved! Great location not far from the local entertainment."
21141369,236900447,2018-02-20,102885631,Addison,"The place was great! The house itself is on a cute, residential street in LoHi. It was quiet and street parking was easy. It’s about a mile away from one of the best restaurant areas in the city (Avanti, Root Down, Little Man Ice Cream, etc). Totally walkable, although we did experience some really cold weather and ended up wimping out with Uber a few times ;-) The apartment has its own entrance and it felt private. The place was spacious and really clean. I was with a friend, so one of us took the bed and the other the sofa, which got high comfort marks. We wanted to experience Denver’s great food, so didn’t really cook, but it was fully equipped and the breakfast nook was super cute. What I really liked was that Brad made everything easy (check-in/check-out, in particular). He was totally responsive, but also let us just do our thing. Highly recommended."
8649742,277576311,2018-06-16,37244172,Myles,"Janet is a great host and very helpful with tips about things to do in Denver. The location is great, within walking distance to a lot. I would stay there again if I'm back in Denver. "

2216969,53140156,2015-11-05,47281924,Dusty,"This was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. I was visiting Colorado for a business trip and had a lot of work to do. He told me I could check in anytime. He has great taste in furniture and the place really felt like home. I would totally stay there again! The whole house is beautiful and when you need to be relaxed, Jeffrey's place is perfect. 

Don't pass it up. Way better then a boring old hotel!

31398949,482638318,2019-07-06,107564318,Laura,Great place and excellent value for the location! Tons of cafes and bars and grocery stores all within walking distance. I’d definitely stay here again!
18449124,273307129,2018-06-05,557511,Sarah & Nathan,"Kristin’s place is beautiful and full of wonderful little touches throughout! She was always responsive and courteous, and went out of her way to help make our stay a pleasant one. 

The stairs to the upstairs bedroom and shower are a little treacherous, as others have mentioned, and my parents who were traveling with us, had some difficulty going up and especially down, but all worked out fine as long as they took their time. 

It is worth noting that the electronic locking system requires that EVERY person who wants to unlock the door and enter the apartment needs to separately download an app, build a profile, upload a photo, verify identity through text AND email,  and turn over data to a third party. Anyone entering the apartment will need to have a smart phone with an active data plan to open the door, since the WiFi is not accessible until you are inside the building. I could see this being a problem for individuals without smart phones, like my parents, or foreign travelers who do not have US data plans and must rely on WiFi when traveling to access the internet. Also, if my phone runs out of battery while I am out all day, normally I would go back to my airbnb to recharge it. It is not possible with this system. If your phone dies, you are locked out and have no way to get in without contacting the host, which you can’t do, because your phone is dead. We definitely had to plan our days differently, travel with a charging cable in my pocket, and leave and come home at the same time together while we were on our trip to Denver, because we had to rely on my smart phone instead of a set of keys to get in and out. "
32961930,425133895,2019-03-17,105822493,Chelsey,"Teena & Hector’s place is exactly as pictured. Very clean, stylish and comfortable. Conveniently located, so close you could hear downtown. Although, the variable sounds were not bothersome to us. 

Hector and Teena met us at the door to give us the keys and explained everything in detail. They were both very nice and quick to respond. I would definitely recommend staying here."
5433111,59932931,2016-01-17,9464212,Eric,"I enjoyed my stay. The space was modern

So nice truly appreciated. Incredibly clean, incredible amenities, and a great location for anything you need on a business trip. I would and plan to stay there again!!"
15084761,310673045,2018-08-19,203377891,Cece,"This space was clean and comfortable, and had all the amenities we were looking for. Nice big walk in closet for two, an updated bathroom, and a functional living space. It is located near the RiNo district, which has a lot to offer in terms of culture and food. Based on what we did (Red Rocks, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Estes Park), we found that we needed a rental car for the longer distances as these drives were an hour and a half. Uber’s to downtown Denver were cheap, and we found plenty to do in the area after our research. The hosts are very responsive and accommodating, and the space is tucked away enough that it feels like your own private apartment. "
23642743,247778335,2018-03-29,18106557,Joel,Great place. Everything we needed for our stay. Wife and kids enjoyed our stay. Jim was very helpful

We spent most our our time in Colorado sight-seeing and hiking but when a break was needed, it was nice to know that we can relax in a quiet and clean place. Thank you again, Eric and Brandy, for sharing your space with us! My daughters and I really enjoyed our time. Hope we can visit again soon!"
13884205,301158464,2018-08-03,36228411,Andrea,This space was perfect and in such a fun neighborhood. Andrea was very helpful & all around great stay!

When it comes to customer service, they were really on top and informative.  
I would definitely recommend to stay at Claudia & Jeremy."

19435120,488051274,2019-07-14,962909,Helen,"David and Cathy’s place is a true gem. The unit is bright, clean, inviting and warm. You feel right at home the moment you walk in. Beyond that though is the hospitality of David and Cathy . Communication is wonderful and this will definitely be on our return list!"

It seemed to be only a few moments to get to each place that we wanted to go within downtown Denver. Their basement apartment is very cute, cozy, and had everything we needed. We would stay there again if we were coming to Denver. They were great hosts as well and made sure that we had what we needed."
8721578,50910860,2015-10-15,44620061,Joshua,Stephanie is a wonderful host! Very helpful and attentive to all guest needs and questions. I highly recommend this BnB!!

21080559,415075278,2019-02-21,242080466,Deni,"Brad and Karie were absolutely fantastic hosts! The space was so cute and stylish, love the separate entry and the backyard area was so cute with a fire pit and easy access to everything downtown Denver! My first trip to Colorado and Brad was so helpful in providing insights about where to go and what to do. The location was ideal, walking distance to coffee and shops and short drive to downtown Denver. Wouldn't have changed a thing!! Small kitchen but we didn't want nor need much in that sense but they had a great little coffee maker and some delicious coffee ready for us to brew! Also a mini fridge and kitchen seating area for small meals. The whole place was So cozy, the bed was so comfy, the fireplace was above and beyond relaxing, the additional futon was deceptively comfortable it blew my mind! I would definitely stay here again next time I come to Denver! Thank you so much Brad and Karie!"
1733052,143608566,2017-04-12,117813211,John,Awesome location. Clean and spacious apartment within walking distance to many restaurants. Great value.

27432643,564793176,2019-11-16,93752834,Rebecca,"We had a good experience at the AirBnB. It was clean and cute! Also, in a prime Denver location. The only hard thing about this spot was getting your vehicle in and out of the gates parking spot, which we were glad they had. A smaller car would be much easier to get in and out than the midsized suv we had. Overall, we had a good experience!"
21042587,324165127,2018-09-16,74509275,Linda,"Matt’s place was spacious, charming and in a great location close to downtown but with the feel of a suburban neighborhood.  Check in was easier and Matt had great communication.  Highly recommend!"
24689489,431753545,2019-04-01,61434393,Mary,Susan and John were warm and welcoming hosts.  I communicated with them and arranged for two friends to stay with them and the arrangements went smoothly.  My friends had a great stay!
19053449,520614097,2019-08-30,55730428,Miles,The row house is in a wonderful location in Denver. We had tickets to a baseball game and were able to walk to Coors Field and enjoy a great game. The space is large and modern.  Roger is an attentive host. Communication through messaging is quick and easy.

2267500,69194368,2016-04-10,1484691,Scott,"Great experience overall.  The neighborhood is perfect, great commercial district two blocks away, quiet street of residential.  Walkable to other neighborhoods including downtown which we did the first day.  

The place is small and quaint.  It has multiple rooms but it's not large enough to where you can actually separate yourself much from whomever you're staying with.  

Hosts were responsive and friendly, and clearly have an appreciation for home design."
29606917,480451895,2019-07-02,80964907,Sasha,"Tracey was quick to respond, the location is perfect, the place is super cute and private. I would definitely stay there again if I was visiting Denver. However, if you are allergic to cats and have a bad allergy to them I would look elsewhere as my fiancé had a hard time breathing and sneezed through the night here. Also this is a basement room with low ceilings so if you are tall like my 6’7 fiancé be prepared to hunch over the whole time. If you are average height and aren’t allergic to cats, this place is perfect and the host goes above and beyond to make the place comfortable and ensures it is stocked with all the amenities you need. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, body wash, feminine products, hair dryer, etc. The kitchen had coffee and a super cute breakfast nook. Also the internet connection was strong so I was able to work remotely from there."

20324521,223697952,2018-01-01,21809495,Cody,Spent 4 nights here over NYE. Place was clean and had every amenity you could ask for. It is a bright room near train tracks but Aaron thoughtfully provides you with sleep masks and ear buds to make it not a problem at all. We slept great and will definitely be back soon.
21486523,472952225,2019-06-20,34850483,Arturo,"Best value for a great stay in Denver. A stylish tiny house with all the amenities you might require for a short stay. Tim is a very thoughtful host, quick to respond and help out. The location is great, everything you need for a comfortable stay in Denver is close by: coffee shops, breweries, delicious restaurants, dispensaries, and a 24 hour quick shop about a block away. RiNo district is a great bohemian, trendy hipster area to hang out and enjoy a bit of the young culture Denver has to offer. Would stay again 10/10"

9009513,74012000,2016-05-12,57810130,Emily,Katie's home was the most inviting and perfect Airbnb experience I've had yet. No complaints here. The location was perfect. The fridge was stocked with beverages and the wifi and Netflix worked perfectly. Katie was always reachable and suggested great places to eat and drink. We got to meet Katie briefly and she couldn't have been nicer. I will definitely be staying here again.

I just needed an affordable, quiet place for the night and that's exactly what this place delivers. (I didn't get to meet Casey nor, somehow, take advantage of the kegerator in the kitchen.) The lockbox situation makes it easy to get in/check out. "

19437073,204165229,2017-10-16,73975064,Alex,"The house was great! Exactly as pictured. The hot tub has a nice speaker system, lights up, and is really nice on a cold night. All appliances are brand new, overall had a great stay and will definitely come again."
27933185,453361437,2019-05-15,194068397,Matthew,"Chill house close to downtown. Bella works nights so I didn't see her the entire time, but she never waited more than 5 minutes to respond to my messages. Check in is easy and my fiancee and I never had any concerns. The in-room AC is super nice."

Very good location within walking and uber distance of downtown Denver attractions, as well as a short drive to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre! Would stay here again!"

36775182,545125632,2019-10-11,71183795,Sandi,Loved this little bungalow and the location. Very accessible to the city as well as seeing the sites surrounding Denver. The studio is exactly as described and viewed and Megan was very helpful with our stay and finishing our Colorado trip! Our hosts were very interested in making our visit the best! Couldn’t ask for better hosts!!

915016,29391911,2015-04-07,20946359,Pam,"Our time at this cozy spot worked well for us.  The hosts were accommodating; the space was clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed.  Since we were there for a week, it was convenient to have a washer and dryer in the apartment.  Also, we liked the fact that Cheesman Park and grocery stores were within walking distance.  We hope to return for another enjoyable stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) Pam & Perr (Website hidden by Airbnb) "

32739257,459788877,2019-05-27,100078569,Carole,Our stay at the urban oasis was great! Aprel has thought of everything to make a stay very enjoyable. The unit was clean and quiet. Aprel responded quickly to our questions. We would definitely stay with Aprel at her urban oasis again.
13744375,145716967,2017-04-19,119690549,Jaymie,"We are visiting from Cali with two toddlers and Mark made sure to go above and beyond to make out stay comfortable. The communication was great, we loved the location it was secluded away from all the noise but close to everything you need. Also amazing running/Biking trail. Only down falls were no assigned parking so first come first serve and public laundry but over all this is an amazing little place for the price. "
22119120,413561611,2019-02-17,11334562,Kira,"Overall, SloHi was a decent spot. If you are looking for a stylish home in pristine condition, this is not going to be your favorite spot. The outside of the home and homes in the neighborhood were not well-kept, the stairs leading to the basement were narrow and if you’re tall, you’re likely to hit your head on the top, and the door to the basement where you are staying is very finicky. The first morning, we weren’t even able to open it, I had to call Ricardo to see how to open it. It was nice to have a kitchenette, even though we didn’t use it. Also came with a fridge, which was nice to put a case of water in for the week. There was good hot water in the shower. The bathroom door does not have locks on it and the bedroom doors don’t have locks, just a little latch lock to keep the door closed when you’re changing. The beds were comfortable. Overall, not a terrible experience, but nothing to blow your socks off."
35940725,546487290,2019-10-13,245387041,Jeff,Chris is a great host who was always quick to respond to any questions we had during our stay.  A great place and nice location to spend some time in Denver.

23034653,515275618,2019-08-22,11380609,Sun Jung,"Vincent was a well communicated nice host for sure. However as a basement house, it was a bit humid. A/C controller was on the upper level, which was out of control from this basement lebel airbnb, we had to ask Vincent to turn it on, of course Vincent solved the problem right away. When we first got in, we found out that our towels were not perfectly dried so we had to turn on the dryer to dry towels. I think there could be another choice if you are not good at bearing hot and humid atmosphere !"
38601456,557310726,2019-10-31,246123685,Rachel,We wanted a place with hot tub and we seen this room and thought it be perfect! But once there and looking for the hot tub and realizing it didn't have one we were disappointed and the fact u can't use anything in the kitchen  was  let down. But all in all if u just need place to sleep for a night this is definitely a good place. But if ur looking for more of home environment this isn't the place.
16346720,321565008,2018-09-10,40334804,Randy,Stephanie was a great host! Her house was perfect for a weekend getaway in Denver as well as it being so close to everything!

662431,416482942,2019-02-24,48187171,Emily,"Had a great stay here in the heart of the Washington Park neighborhood. Street parking is readily available, and the electronic lock makes check in very easy. Studio was impeccably clean and filled with great amenities like coffee, instant oatmeal, a noise machine, and “just in case” toiletries (like the travel hairbrush I snagged). My only complaint (not really a complaint at all) is that it is perilously close to the delicious Bonnie Brae Ice Cream shop. I greatly appreciated waking up to a well-shoveled/salted walkway the morning after a pretty decent snowfall."
13769168,234168501,2018-02-11,127597695,Selena,Enjoyed our stay at Rachel’s place during our winter holiday. The house was very comfortable and was equipped with everything we needed. I would’ve loved to have stayed longer! We got to meet Rachel briefly and she provided us with some suggestions of local places to check out. She was also very responsive to any questions I had. Highly recommend this place.

20170743,210320118,2017-11-08,12481062,Maciej,Very nice and quite place. Its only a 15 minute walk to the convention center. I highly recommend staying here for anyone in Denver for a conference.
20292902,494620398,2019-07-24,56261405,Marc,"I had a fantastic stay, I was warmly welcomed and shown to my room before having the amenities explained to me as well as being offered a coffee. The room itself is excellent appointed with a comfortable double bed and brilliantly sized ensuite bathroom.

26281796,315751712,2018-08-29,208341776,Elizabeth,Crashpad was indeed close to the airport - was perfect for one night after flying in to Denver pretty late.

10088031,419378991,2019-03-03,124760369,Taeler,"This was our second time staying with Dale and the first time at this property but same location. The location is awesome, the clarity of the instructions is great for easy check in and out. Everyone was clean and the rooms were nice. We met Sarah as well the co-host and she was super friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be staying with Dale on our next trip to Denver."
17331962,567131090,2019-11-21,54876622,Kathleen,"A small but extremely charming, clean place ... perfect for solo travelers or couples. About the best value I’ve found on Airbnb!"

15506280,285090691,2018-07-02,196496429,Alan,"Clean and serene: Gerry’s place is a great launch point and welcome respite from a day of touristing Denver’s many destinations.  Just minutes away from parks, shopping and cool spots.  

Gerry was a generous host, patiently shepherding my wife and I through our rookie ABnB, despite  - immediately obvious - not having read the house manual’s rule #1.  His restaurant recommendations and sightseeing tips were spot-on!  Keep the light on, Gerry."

8211278,278319420,2018-06-17,3703134,Daniel,"Debbie and Stew are great hosts - very quick to respond, check-in was super easy. House was clean. Really good dive bar across the street for late nights when you get home. 

Layout of the house is pretty weird - two really small bathrooms, some bedrooms are connected to each other, no A/C, lots of light in the morning so hard to sleep in. It worked for our needs because there weren't many other options for 6 bedrooms."
21069616,324775438,2018-09-17,55625803,Chris,The place was very clean when we arrived. All the check-in instructions were extremely easy to follow. There is only one car parking pass but there is a lot a couple blocks down and parking is free right on the street on Sunday’s. Whole Foods is a few blocks down the street and there are plenty of other places to eat within a short walk. Lots of room for 6 people to sleep. The air mattress and couch were both comfortable to sleep on. Great stay overall.

11277311,489945339,2019-07-17,99774493,Christine,"Great place - love that this is a private room and private bath within Teddy's home.  This was the first time I have stayed in a location where I had to enter through the host's home to get to my room.  While I didn't see them often due to my schedule, Teddy (and Tara) made me feel very comfortable when entering and exiting the home.   Room was very clean, comfortable and in a nice location!   Loved having all the toiletries in the bathroom!  Easy to access, walking distance to the convention center, capitol and 16th street mall.   Highly recommend Teddy's place if you want a nice space for a great price!"

4753876,96465282,2016-08-22,26473965,Amanda,"Truly adorable space in RiNo district.  Perfect for couple or person traveling on business. Space is neat and tidy, and within steps of great coffee shop and some great restaurants.  About 20 minutes from Coors field, and walking distance from many breweries. "
15534324,227037760,2018-01-13,13376312,Alexis,"Cute, cozy home in a nice quiet neighborhood in walking distance to restaurants, coffee and nightlife. Kat was very accommodating during our stay and allowed us to check in early, which was much appreciated! There was a bit of train noise at night, which woke us up My Cousin Vinny style. All in all, we had a great stay and loved the style of the place!"

27570484,523920212,2019-09-04,235950512,Alyssa,"Jessica and Greg were truly outstanding hosts and their home FAR exceeded any expectations we had! It's extremely up-to-date with top notch finishes and they pay so much attention to every little detail; there literally was not a thing we could think of that they didn't already provide. 
Our whole family stayed at their bungalow, including our 2 month old baby, and upon arrival they had a pack n play, baby bath, and changing pad set up for us. (Literally the most thoughtful hosts!) 
Every piece of furniture is gorgeous and staying there was more comfortable than staying at the nicest hotel we could have afforded. We spent the majority of our time around their gorgeous island and outdoor living area. We truly could not have had a better experience and will recommend Jessica and Gregs bungalow to any and everyone who goes to Denver. We will also hope to always secure their home whenever we go back!"
3939645,38191787,2015-07-13,37107286,Sebastian,"Kim has a lovely cottage and is a gracious, friendly host.  The room is comfortable and amenities clean and neat."
19047815,207664898,2017-10-29,79046563,Mike,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Ryan and Danica’s place. It was nice to have the whole basement to myself, complete with my private kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and living area with TV. Because of the privacy granted by the living situation, I only saw Ryan a couple times, but he was a great host nonetheless. Also, since it’s located right off I-70, the accommodation made it easy to travel to and from Denver and the surrounding area. I highly recommend staying with Ryan and Danica if you get the chance!"
15094515,544666868,2019-10-10,83122816,Ashleigh,Sadly I didn’t get to stay longer. This is such a cute space that may look small in pictures but it’s a lot more spacious than it seems once inside! It’s a little different than just a normal 2 bedroom. The loft was very fun to sleep in and the personal touches around the entire house was amazing!! Would definitely recommend!!
30566935,528765444,2019-09-13,81510866,Erika,Really responsive host who was helpful. Even though the unit is in the basement you can’t hear anything above like footsteps - I was pleasantly surprised about that. Quiet and private space. Comfortable bed and bedding. The unit could use some cosmetic TLC but the overall a good experience.
24043228,299762493,2018-07-31,16444615,Jasmine,"I had a very positive experience staying at the carriage house. It was a cozy tiny house with lots of thoughtful touches. I was alone for part of my stay and I couldn’t have felt more comfortable or safe. I had more than I needed. I loved the backyard patio and the easy access to Tennyson. It was perfect!!

The shower and kitchen are darling. I would honestly live in a place like this in a heartbeat!

Thanks again! "

35520755,547135604,2019-10-14,152077701,Suzie,"An okay space to stay. However, you would get more space just staying at a hotel. Just wasn’t exactly what we had expected. But a nice place with good amenities for quick stays. The host is great and had awesome communication!"
12365447,242400530,2018-03-11,116623912,Henry,"Super clean. Had pro hotel touches like baggage holders, towels, snacks, guest guide. The 2 bedrooms are big. We had a friend sleep on the couch downstairs which was nice. The 2 bathrooms were pretty big. You can tell there was a lot of pride in the details and decor. 

The neighborhood was pretty amazing (Rhino, Larimer St). It reminded me a lot of Logan Square or Wicker Park or Pilsen neighborhoods in Chicago. Good coffee, shopping, breweries nearby. The graffiti nearby was an attraction on our bike tour."

8686305,528215214,2019-09-12,2487276,Jerry,"Wow Billy’s home is fantastic.  Plenty of room, and everything you could want or need!  Billy was super nice & just wants to make sure your every detail is cared for.  I had plenty of privacy but also had some great conversations.  The kitchen & BBQ is super nice and allowed me to do all my cooking. The bed is comfy & the balcony is beautiful for reading & relaxing. Bathroom is luxe as is the whole property.  Easy parking right by front door too.  The town has lots of cool park spaces & restaurants & grocery store.  I visited Casey’s, Chipotle, Cycleton (for a fast bike repair) and everything was great.  Close to Golden, Airport, downtown, etc...you may find a closer place to be more ‘downtown’ but it wont be as amazing as Billy’s place.  I’m staying again later this month & can’t wait!"
23749580,506439316,2019-08-10,174632246,Matthew,Leah’s place was outstanding. Great location. She was very quick to respond to any questions and helped out with anything we needed. Would stay here again 100%

24379303,283855905,2018-06-30,22917044,Ash,Great place to stay!!
15271643,563683528,2019-11-13,170802193,Kelsey,If you like art this is a must stay. The space was unique and had original art on the walls! This space is the perfect location - very walk-able to all the fun spots. The keyless entry was nice too. The host is around to help with anything you may need!
1959836,15678836,2014-07-14,12573659,Kristi,"Anne welcomed me with a big smile and showed me around the place making sure I knew that I was encouraged to make myself at home.  This was my first Airbnb experience and after my stay at Anne's, I'm really happy I went this route.  For me, traveling alone, it was nice having someone I could check in with and not just be another nameless face that passes by the hotel desk.  The room was nicely decorated.  The bed was a little firm and lumpy but I had no problem sleeping.  There is no AC but the fan worked just fine.  The shower always had hot water.  My only suggestion would be to add some sort of mirror in the room.  A full length being ideal.  Overall, I had a great experience staying with Ann and would stay there again. "
29762898,477683029,2019-06-28,261431160,Charles,"Great space in a quiet part of Denver.  Very close to everything.  Jarrod was a great host.  For those looking for the stimulation of a tv, make sure to bring some sort of entertainment as there’s no tv in the living room or bedroom."
4504068,71423930,2016-04-25,1857718,Juanny,Very gracious couple and was able to fix a mixup in communication without any issues or trouble. 
4817072,318297431,2018-09-03,146496307,Neal,"The house is perfectly fine and is in a great location, but it is not large by any means. Could be tight for a family or any group requiring space. Backyard is pretty spacious and made the limited time we spent at the house perfectly fine."
756594,4713182,2013-05-21,5882961,Linette,Ling was a great hostess! The space was perfect for our family.  Beds were very comfortable. Netflix access came in handy with kids.  She had stuffed animals and beanbags out as well for our kids.  The homemade scones and jams were great as well.  It was all fantastic.
13656290,441343186,2019-04-21,193143824,Whitney,"Joe and Natty’s place is the perfect place to travel with family. They provided a stroller, pack-n-play, etc. so we didn’t have to worry about traveling out to Denver with those items. The check-in instructions were very clear and communication was great. Their place is only a couple miles from downtown and there is plenty of parking. I would definitely recommend Joe and Natty’s place!"
28914183,359692610,2018-12-17,225675711,Megan,"The queen bed is so comfortable, wish I could’ve brought it home with me! Minutes from tons of great places. Awesome amenities, they really took the time to think about their guests. Easy check-in/out process."
14440882,326213177,2018-09-21,62329759,Alice,"wonderful clean space, lots of things to do in the area. Staying in the Secret Garden was one of my favourite experiences of all time. Will definitely recommend to others!"
1106479,344432751,2018-11-03,222289665,Corinne,"Attractive, bright & cheery second-floor private room&bath w. large flat screen TV.   Heavenly double-bed w. loads of pillows/blankets & good reading lamp.  Thoughtfully provided full-size robe plus other amenities one doesn't always pack, e.g., an alarm clock!  I chose not to cook in her ""chef's kitchen;""  it's generously sized & well supplied.  Julie may retire to a private third-floor den leaving her tranquil, first-floor living room available for guests to read or compute.  Charming, walkable, historic neighborhood."
24962636,467674951,2019-06-10,249272556,Brandon,"The location of this apartment is prime! Not in the heart of downtown, but downtown enough to make a lot of places convenient to you. I wax shocked how close club vinyl was to our place. Apartment room itself was very nice and tidy; Joey provided a good supply of amenities along with great hospitality! Communication was smooth and I would definitely recommend this stay to guests in the future."
8183443,77188848,2016-05-30,59384940,Whitney,Dennis was great! Despite that our flight got in as his was leaving he still worked with us and made sure we were able to get the keys. His place was also perfect! Incredible views of Denver. Location is unbeatable. 
6436594,510114630,2019-08-15,48589606,Andrew,"I'll be as brutally honest as I can here. The downtown Denver area has a big homelessness problem and that being said, there are a lot of junkies around though our stay was fine right around the premises. When you enter the building, it smells pretty off (which seem to subside each morning but return throughout the day) but the unit smells fine. Seems like there is some water damage to a few of the walls around and in the bathroom so not sure if that adds anything to it. Unit is fine and will do the trick for a budget friendly trip. Parking space included is nice since parking on the street is very tough though it can feel a little sketchy since it's a bit closed in. You won't want to do any walking around at night since it's not the safest downtown area. I definitely recommend getting a ride to and from the place. Anthony is very detailed about check-in and info on the building so that was nice for anyone that likes to have every aspect planned out. Overall, this is good for the value but if you're also looking for comfort, I'd go ahead and shell out the extra bucks and get a hotel or maybe stay a little further from the downtown area."
35082201,466802191,2019-06-09,184775746,Sue,"Jennifer and Troy were great hosts!  Issues were addressed immediately so as not to interfere with vacation!  Cute Home, very comfortable!"

4978830,72487133,2016-05-02,58756688,Laura,Araceli was very welcoming! Loved the house it was perfect for my family (we were 10). The house was super clean. It was great to have everyone together at the house instead of a hotel. We were able to cook the kitchen is fully stocked with all the necessities. We will definitely stay here again when we go back to the Denver area.
35936980,486497766,2019-07-12,79393152,Pauline,Awesome hosts!
21080559,421132556,2019-03-08,180934289,Arielle,"Brad's space was cozy, spacious, and clean! We were in and out a lot for hiking in the surrounding area and exploring the city, but coming back to a space like this was very comforting!"
7931953,563419999,2019-11-12,7009067,Anne,"This is a cute little place in a great neighborhood. I love that the owners were kind enough to leave basic supplies for guests - extra tea, a bit of canola oil, herbs and spices, etc. Very welcoming."
28964822,457209516,2019-05-23,11044713,Kristin,"Jenn's place is terrific - my highest compliment for AirBnB hosts is that the space is exactly as described in the listing.  Great location/centrally located, quiet, comfortable bed, clean.
Second highest compliment is that I would definitely stay with her again!"
1456614,51141915,2015-10-18,14502866,Marci,"This apartment was perfect for my stay in Denver and was everything advertised. Erin was warm, welcoming and helpful. She was easily accessible if needed. Her dogs were an added plus to the welcoming committee. The apartment was simple and clean and I had access to her lovely, grassy backyard as well. The neighborhood was quiet and safe for me as a single woman to walk around by myself, even at night. It was easily accessible to some great restaurants, a supermarket and the highways.  I would stay here again on another visit! "
23308230,423846978,2019-03-15,81099916,Madison,The host canceled this reservation 105 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17303217,193241945,2017-09-12,126957435,Peter,"This place was perfect for our business trip. The house was beautiful and looked even better than we expected. It's tastefully decorated, clean and modern inside - and it was the ideal size for us (3 travellers). The neighbourhood is is pleasant and located near a grocery store and restaurants. Steven was a wonderful host - he was a clear communicator and even went out of his way to offer us some extras information about the neighbourhood. Amazing experience overall!"
24344869,353160281,2018-11-26,49792426,Vaithi,"This was total value for money. Excellent location, beautiful house, and it felt like Peter's been doing this for years and years. Very straight forward check in instructions, thoughtful touches in the bedroom (white noise machine, fan). Very close to the airport. I would definitely recommend starting at Peter's house."
13656290,542748238,2019-10-06,38458270,Emma,"This place is awesome. Cozy, comfortable and well stocked. Would definitely stay in again on our next trip to Denver."

32139098,423010913,2019-03-12,85982237,Will,Great stay. comfortable and clean. Would highly recommend!
1905596,32218551,2015-05-15,23975099,Rory,Everything about Annette's places was great. She greeted us very warmly and even with homemade croissants (from her grandchildren that were visiting.) Annette can tell you so much about the area. We will stay here again and again when in Denver. 
13226115,207200133,2017-10-28,70980399,Kristin,"Was in Denver for a quick trip so I didn't spend too much time in the room. Great neighborhood, nice hosts, easy parking!"
15743145,517604655,2019-08-25,270046285,Leigh,"My group really liked the space! Plenty of room fora  group and the amenities are nice. Walls are a bit thin so if you're a light sleeper you'll want the upstairs room. The apartment is in a cute and clearly up and coming area, but isn't quite close enough to RiNo that you will want to walk to things. Also, the botanic gardens are super close, and that's a great morning activity."
3425074,563039844,2019-11-11,135085107,Valerie,"Kimberly is an absolutely lovely and very welcoming host! Very helpful with advice on things to do in the area, a charming home, and provides you with everything you need."

19195333,161903387,2017-06-18,27752266,Harry,"Cynthia was an excellent host. We were the first guests in her home and she made us feel very welcome. When we arrived, she gave us some excellent tips on where to go and what to see in Denver. Her place is in an extremely convenient place, only a walk or a short car ride to downtown and the nightlife. She also has one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on!"
13845981,193231986,2017-09-12,22539077,Tomer,"Becki and John's house is amazing, I would definitely recommend everyone to stay there.
The room is big with private bathroom and shower, great bed and curtains make it perfect for those who like to sleep late, there is a great private entrance through the garage , great living room and amazing roof!
I came for a night to see a Broncos match and I am so glad I chose to stay there, We had drinks on the roof and then walked together to the stadium, which was awesome.
If you come to see a game this is definitely the place for you!, And also if you just come to town for a few days and are looking for a great place and great hosts, this is the place!"
7919653,72236503,2016-05-01,61579118,Gidget,"Colleen checked on us several times to ensure we had everything we needed.  My daughter called this ""a castle"" and the swim-spa was incredible.  I wish the weather was nicer because the outside lounging area is gorgeous, and I would have loved to walk to the zoo.  

This is the nicest house on the block.  Don't plan on parking an extended cab pickup in the garage - it won't fit.  

We recommend this home without reservation."
15644895,227402521,2018-01-14,26874334,James,"Very nice place with ample room and wonderful location in Cherry Creek.  Easy access walking or driving.  All was just as described.  And we had a great family dinner in celebration of my uncle who had passed.  The kitchen and dual eating areas was great.  My brother did whine a little about the smallish tv, but that wasn't a focal point anyway."
6891514,146721470,2017-04-23,122551004,Kara,We had a great time staying at Elizabeth's! She is very nice. Elizabeth helped give us options of some fun things to do. Close to downtown Denver. The room and bathroom were clean!
24043228,499620915,2019-07-31,170253845,Montana,Beautiful and cozy little cottage! Definitely recommend.
29564369,553236767,2019-10-23,54327827,Carly,"The place was clean, perfect for a couple, and in a great neighborhood. Andy was a great host. We would gladly stay here again!"
8954951,168627818,2017-07-09,33151242,Margot,"This was a wonderful home. Beautiful, modern, and perfect for all of our needs. Ena was very easy to communicate with.

16165056,511664921,2019-08-17,46950446,Christian,"Das Haus ist schön und die Kommunikation verlief einfach. 
Aber: Es gibt kein Frühstück, obwohl es in der Anzeige mit drin ist! Auch ist das Zimmer im Keller und somit dunkel - die Bilder sind vom anderen Raum. 
Leider war die Gastgeberin nicht bereit ihre Anzeige richtig zu stellen!
Sauber ist aber alles und man hat seine Ruhe. Somit zu empfehlen, wenn einen die beiden Punkte nicht stören."
26197109,327429166,2018-09-23,82189357,Dan,A private and centrally located place.  10/10 I will defiantly stay here again!
1594161,108597205,2016-10-16,56900886,Kelsey,"Brian and Tarryn were wonderful hosts! The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. They have a cupboard full of any toiletry items that you may have forgotten, water bottles and breakfast items in the fridge, and some snacks and chocolate on the counter. The location is absolutely perfect - it was a quick and inexpensive Uber or Lyft ride to anywhere we wanted to go (we went to Red Rocks, Golden, and downtown Denver). If we come back to Denver, I would be more than happy to stay here again! "
27554725,508947045,2019-08-13,29092078,Sophia,"Stayed here with a friend for two nights and used it as a hub to visit the city and go hiking in the mountains. Super chill place. Jeremiah had the room ready with two beds for us. Very friendly and welcoming and he had great local recommendations. Everything in the place was labeled, which was really useful. Plenty of storage space for luggage in the room, good parking options, and most of all: good value."
13815789,477617132,2019-06-28,235476095,Alexandria,The location is amazing! The space was huge and the value was superb!

9523086,75822671,2016-05-23,64969816,Mike,"I did not get to meet Eric in person, mainly because I was out enjoying the area. We did exchange text messages and he was very nice and responsive. The neighborhood is great and there are plenty of excellent restaurants and bars within walking distance. You can also take an Uber or Lyft downtown for around $7. The room was comfortable and clean and so was the bathroom. I would definitely stay there again the next time I'm in town. "
21563426,506500874,2019-08-10,56643159,Sam,"Tony's place is very nice, conveniently located to several restaurants and coffee shops, as well as, easy access to downtown. Tony is very accommodating, I have no complaints. His dog, Buddy, is very friendly too."

861993,187857404,2017-08-27,57286851,Clarisa,"John and Shann were excellent hosts. Extremely accommodating for us and our two dogs. They allowed us to check in early and even provided us with a couple of blankets for a concert. They were extremely friendly and their place was very clean and exactly as pictured. We would definitely stay with them again and would highly recommend them to anyone. As a bonus, they have a really cute dog."
21281527,539153448,2019-09-30,61391777,David,"Stephen was a fantastic host; very communicative, accommodating and friendly!  The place was cozy and exactly as described; perfect for someone that needs a quick place to stay near downtown.  Great bathroom and shower, mini-fridge/freezer and a nice TV.  Bed was comfortable.  The location is not the best and I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable walking any where from there (though I'd probably have been fine), but again, this was as-described so I knew what I was getting into.  Even though the surrounding area isn't the best, I never felt unsafe as there is a locked gate and private, gated parking.   Note that while the space is on it's own floor, it's not what you'd consider totally ""private"" as the only way out of the apt is past your space, which is behind a folding divider.  Sound carries in the apt as well, but again, this was all described accurately in the listing, so this isn't meant as a knock on the place at all... simply a note so that those booking it will understand and not be surprised.  All-in-all, it was exactly what I was looking for and a great value for being so close to downtown (it was a 5 min Uber ride to Coors field and bar/restaurants).  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Stephen!"
21422875,233039485,2018-02-07,93770871,Tima,Awesome place to stay very convenient to get anywhere you need. Michelle is an amazing host and is very helpful and will make sure you know where everything is and will even help you get there.  If you are looking for a fun place to stay for a great price then look no further. Highly recommend this place for anyone traveling to Denver you not regret it!!!!

23060656,288802885,2018-07-10,173729976,Alek,My girlfriend and I spent a week here and loved every moment. Great roof top views and the hot tub really helped sooth our aching body's after days of hiking. Walking distance to Denver and all it has to offer. Nadim and Chris were great hosts and were very helpful and knowledgeable.
13884205,329392968,2018-09-28,167010347,Matt,Great location just outside downtown Denver. Clean space with every amenity one could want
15094515,462030829,2019-06-01,259463185,Katie,This place was easy to get to.  The boho chic vibe depicted in the photos was as expected and my teenage daughter loved that!  the mattresses were comfy.  I chose to park in front because the parking in back was not easy to get in and out of.
16172759,300625308,2018-08-02,23525110,Vijay,Hannah made the check in and out process very easy. The place was extremely clean and a great location!

You can walk to many great restaurants, coffee shops, and City Park. He was easy to get in contact with and always kind and helpful. I would definitely recommend staying here while in Denver!"
15507830,174654707,2017-07-26,21718760,Amanda,"Bob's place is superbly presented, extremely comfortable and well equipped.  The space is private and cosy, but still reasonably spacious.  The windows are small (the space being a basement), but it's very well lit (and several of the lights have dimmers).

Bob made us extremely welcome and we wouldn't hesitate to stay with him again.

The low ceiling really is low; I am 6'1"" and had no problems, but if you're any taller, you'll need to be careful on the stairwell and in the middle of the living area."

The guest house was beyond our expectations (both in terms of style and functionality), the host's hospitality and friendliness was superb and heartfelt. We felt so at home and welcomed. To top it off, the bed in the guest house was the most comfortable bed we have probably ever slept in. The following morning we went to Crema - one of Claire's local recommendations - and absolutely loved it. We can only say good things about Claire, her family, and the guest house! / Hansa "
10363495,120931998,2016-12-12,34686811,Gregory,The home was in a great central location near downtown Denver. Close to shopping and restaurants.

21080559,548051562,2019-10-16,94874043,Jon,"(Using the same review b/c we stayed here 3 nights over 2 stays)

My wife and I went to Denver for a short vacation of 4 nights.  Since we spent one of those nights outside the city, Brad's place was great for us in allowing to book the three non-consecutive evenings.  The bed was very comfy, we had ample space to roam around, and the bathroom had everything we needed.  We also liked the neighborhood.  It was in walking distance of the light rail, there's a few places to eat within a 10 min walk (shout-out to Uno Mas Taqueria!), and it's right off the interstate for easy travel.  Brad was quickly responsive and able to accomoate us throughout the stay.

We will definitely check this place out next time we're in Colorado, and so should you!"

Maggie and Sam are wonderful hosts."
14010321,239666142,2018-03-02,162914187,Philip,Herbert's place is awesome and every thought has been given to providing amenities from tea and coffee to plentiful plush towels. This is literally AirBnB at its best.

8649742,256815727,2018-04-23,2172933,Emmanuel,"Such an amazing experience! 
Location- Being just a block away from 16th street mall, makes it super accesible if you want to move inside or outside downtown. 
Apartment- The apartment was really tide. Everything well organized. I really loved it since it felt very cozy. The view to the mountains is just breathtaking... Moreover if it has recently snowed its just spectacular.
Host- Janet was really easy to reach. She was very helpful trying to solve any issue I could have. She even welcomed me with essentials. I had great conversations with her. She gave me awesome tips. Such a really really nice person. The city- Denver is a great city. You may see homeless people around downtown, but I did not felt threatened or harrased by them. 
The room has a private bathroom, and I think its more of what I expected for what I paid. 
Quick tip- Sams Dinner No. 3. Cool place to breakfast any time. Really good food. 

Thanks for everything Janet!"
590,26838833,2015-02-20,21842936,Rob,Jill really has this hosting business done to a science. Beginning with great communication before to providing a very comfortable and relaxing living space. We would make a return to her home our first choice when we visit Denver again. The area of park hill is very close to the downtown and its attractions but Is a quiet residential area that is a welcome retreat
21183938,256339720,2018-04-22,179213235,Sergio,Very clean and close to EVERYTHING. Worth every penny!
852934,451403425,2019-05-11,96378271,Olivia,"It’s nice to be next to the highway. Makes this listing really accessible if you’re driving. It’s definitely got a quirky 70s vibe that makes it an interesting and affordable option. Vivian is clear and very responsive. Go for it, can sleep several people comfortably."
19983083,338527592,2018-10-19,212335813,Chase,Definitely a place you want to stay! Teagan is so sweet and accommodating! Beautiful house with a great location. The back yard alone is to die for! Definitely will be staying there again in the future!
4263714,70356889,2016-04-17,7766986,Fabian,Melissa and John provided us with great tips about what to do in this wonderful neighborhood! The place was incredibly clean and quiet. The entire stay was very well organized and communication before our arrival was excellent. We were so thankful to have such a cozy and tidy place to stay. Highly recommended! 
1733052,158136786,2017-06-05,91205032,Mary Jo,Jason's place was exactly as pictured. Very clean and homey feeling. Walkable to a variety of options. Loved it!
21796586,325060052,2018-09-18,125210554,Jayne,"Alicia and Josh have really put a lot of effort and thought into creating an amazing guest space.  I knew it would be nice based off the photos and reviews but it is better in person. I loved the multiple phone chargers ready to go by the beds, nightlights, electric fireplace, well stocked kitchen, and the thoughtful touches: sign, making it easy to find, and the muffins and coffee for our early morning flight were much appreciated. it is very well kept and spotlessly clean.  I'm so glad we chose to stay here!"
21026144,477174589,2019-06-27,36741614,Peter,"We had a wonderful stay here! The room was cozy and we felt super welcome. Charles the Cat was very sweet. 

The location was great as well.  Walking distance to several fantastic coffee shops, cafes, and breweries. 

If we're ever back in Denver, we would be more than happy to stay here again. Thank you!"

We loved how close it was to many activities in the city like downtown, the aquarium, the zoo, museums, etc. Besides that, the home was beautiful & very modern! Our host was awesome! She made our stay comfortable & easy! "

30068089,444954213,2019-04-28,71319374,Holly L.,"Great location and home for a weekend getaway hosting 6! While we explored during the day, the roof was a great place to finish off the evening viewing a sunset over the city."

8248031,179136746,2017-08-06,94396629,Carolina,We stayed at Tom's place for a long weekend for a friends wedding and it was perfect! It is in a beautiful neighborhood about a 15 minute drive from the downtown area. The apartment itself was spacious and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and can't wait to come back!
4236002,27096944,2015-02-25,4195549,Matthew,"There was an easy check in, the space was perfect for our trip, great location to have as a home base to explore what Denver has to offer. "

16855990,128809684,2017-01-27,104021950,Nicole,"Ashley was absolutely wonderful! She went above and beyond to accommodate to us. Her place is super cute, and clean. To my surprise, she had a delightful backyard for us to use that is private and fenced in with a fire pit and seating area. If I'm ever in Denver again and need a place to stay I would certainly stay with Ashley again. Only slight downfall is her apartment is in an older neighborhood not really close to any stores or restaurants.  However, I kind of knew this going into staying here so I still hands down give her 5 stars!"
18909046,296855534,2018-07-26,32371389,Christine,"Nice place to stay if you’re planning to be out all day. Like other reviews said, bed was uncomfortable and it was a bit hard to sleep through the whole night. You can also hear every footstep from the guests upstairs but it wasn’t a bother since we were only there to sleep and get ready for the next day. Before arriving, we read that there was no AC and was a bit worried but there was absolutely no problem. The fans worked just fine for us! Backyard was very useful for us as well. Would stay again! "
17024740,176363979,2017-07-30,45944043,James,This house was great. Extremely clean with everything you could need. The set up out back was perfect for relaxing. Communication was 10 out of 10 with Jeff answering quickly to any questions we had. Check in is also a breeze with the lock box
4294257,359977211,2018-12-18,43144018,Nina,We had a great time! The house is close to everything and there are a bunch of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Travis is great!
760023,6274914,2013-08-06,6019421,Gary,"My wife and I were lucky enough to stay at Jill and Michael's lovely house during our recent visit to Denver. Our room was extremely comfortable and had it's own private bathroom with a roomy soaking tub. The house itself was beautiful and very relaxing, with a  large front porch and large garden backyard. Both Jill and Michael were wonderful hosts and extremely interesting. Our only disappointment was not being able to spend more time with them. We will definitely try to stay with them on our next trip to Denver."

Very clean and cozy with all the amenities we needed to enjoy our stay.  There was even some cold beer left for us in the fridge when we arrived. We will definitely stay here again in the future. 
28489801,552428073,2019-10-21,77753566,Lisa,"Our stay was marked with incredible hospitality, stylish accommodations, and a phenomenal area within walking district. Our host was quick to respond, was extremely helpful in answering any question we had, and was so kind. We couldn’t have asked for a better host or experience. We would definitely go back and stay here. The art work was an added touch that we loved, and the game space downstairs was such a bonus. Loved everything about our stay."

Responded quickly"
1106479,39966008,2015-07-27,3921622,Anthony,"Julia was a great host, easily approachable and cared about making our stay a pleasant one.  Upon arrival, told us about nearby places to go (including gluten free bakery around the corner) and offered coffee, tea and beer (also gave us access to refrigerator).
The room was charming, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was also very clean.
The location might be the highlight if you want to get outside of downtown.  It is in the Uptown area which has a number of great bars and restaurants.  We tried several places and different dishes, many of which were the best food we had in Denver.
Onefold for breakfast is a must!
Thank you Julia for a pleasant stay."
34147762,460241459,2019-05-28,183343980,Hazel,"The space is clean and cozy. My family and I were able to enjoy the weekend playing cards and exploring local areas by foot. The space is located in a quiet yet popular part of downtown. We had plenty of blankets and towels and were grateful for having a washer and dryer on hand. Thanks, Anna!"

4766503,461029592,2019-05-30,241833349,Kevin,Laurel and Paul were very welcoming and helpful without being a hinderance on our privacy which was what we liked since we stayed for half of our honeymoon. The place was beautiful and comfortable and for the price it couldn’t be beat. I’ve paid more at motels in shady neighborhoods than the rate charged for this upscale lodge. It was like being in a five star hotel for one star pricing haha. Corny but true.
23596506,247745944,2018-03-29,180068003,Julianna,"The apartment was very nice and clean, and we had no difficulty coming and going. The apartment is actually 30 minutes away from downtown without traffic. Great place for the price and the host was accommodating and quick to respond to messages."

6578731,91010459,2016-08-03,1179127,Darby,"Great room for layovers and airport proximity.  Big comfortable house and sweetest old dog named Coco.  My only issue was with lack of food/restaurants/delivery nearby.  Grocery Store is 1.2 mile walk, so plan ahead if you need to eat.  Kathy picked me up at the airport for extra charge and I didn't see her again during my stay."
833937,154237341,2017-05-23,17505943,Jairo,"Eliza was an amazing host. Her house is located in "" Five Points"" a tredy and hip up and coming área in Denver. The neighbors were very firnednly but what me and my friends loved the most was that the location is perfect. It's 5 to 10 mins. from downtown and all of the other neighborhoods in Denver. Would most definitely stay there again when in Denver "
30354413,432667134,2019-04-04,49756170,Andrew,"Matthew's place is in the heart of LoHi, one of Denver's most cultured towns. It's a 2 minute walk from Little Man Ice Cream, 3 minute walk from Mizu Izakaya and 10 minute walk to Downtown Denver. If you're looking for an authentic experience of Denver, Matt's place is a great home to stay in."
590,16578071,2014-07-29,12729933,Gloriana,"Jill was very good at communicating exactly when she would be home.  Also,at giving us suggestions for what we might do.  All round helpful!  She even offered us breakfast which unfortunately we could not take advantage of because we had an early flight.  Truly lovely host"

The home is very comfortable for 6 people and is filled with items that highlight Rob’s many travels. The location is close to restaurants, bars and parks. We really enjoyed the biking around the park, walking to the local coffee shop, and soaking in the hot tub at night. The yard is great for entertaining, with space to enjoy the sun and BBQ. This was my first airbnb experience and Rob was a great help, patiently answering all my questions. I would highly recommend booking Rob’s place for your next trip.  "
31026158,449528072,2019-05-06,50155465,Lee-Ling,Super Clean room and nice new condo. wonderful sleep in the night. Meghan is easy to reach and very thoughtful host.

My boyfriend and I landed in Denver at 10am and he was very flexible and accommodating of our early arrival and let us check in then. The place is very clean and comfortable. Banks was friendly and helpful, and although our paths barely crossed he texted us periodically to make sure everything is ok and to offer if we need anything. I'd definitely stay at his place again."
11338921,165298326,2017-06-30,112081049,Lena,"Kristen was beyond accommodating. Her place was absolutely beautiful and so clean!! The check in process was easy and she keeps contact with you so if you do need anything, she responds very quickly. The only downside is the area where the loft it. It is actually very close to everything and close to some awesome restaurants. Just be aware that there is a homeless shelter a block over so there are a lot of homeless outside the loft area. Also the noise level at night is very loud. Besides that the place is amazingggg! "

4753876,69971150,2016-04-15,59332742,Alixandra,Host was great! Apartment was great! Lots of homeless people begging for cigarettes and money. Also the alley light was very bright shining into the bedroom- could use a curtain. 
15344781,133172670,2017-02-20,49356002,Gemma,"Linda's place is fun and colorful with the room being very serene. We loved being close to lots of restaurants, especially Ranch House Cafe, seriously, go get a breakfast burrito. The bed is pretty hard for our taste, more than 3 nights on it might have been a bit rough for us, but Linda's home is really a fantastic place to stay overall!"

We picked this house because they were pet friendly and we needed a place to stay that would host our two kitties.  They were so generous with their space, and making us (and the cats) comfortable.  We will definitely be staying with them again if we're heading through Denver."

Next time I plan to grocery shop and cook because the oven is too amazing to waste on throwing leftovers in a fridge everyday. I was able to walk to all my favorite bars, restaurants, and shops. Things a little further out in the city were all around an $8-11 Lyft ride."

The snacks, juices, and coffee were welcome.  The walkable neighborhood has some small shops and is located close to restaurants, shops, etc.  A quiet but accessible location."

38162891,526407610,2019-09-08,241304089,Eliza,Arielle's place was great. I really enjoyed my stay. There was a separate entrance and the room is in the back of the house. The only shared area is the bathroom. Which was clean and available every time I needed it. The house was clean and looked nice. My only complaint is the room does not have any airflow. Pack your own fan! It's just her and her son that live there and never heard and saw them much during my stay. So it is decently private!

10244515,488878926,2019-07-15,134234240,Norman,"During my stay here, I felt that I was staying in a well cared for home. It was quite comfortable, not like other properties that feel setup just for rental. There are several outdoor spaces to enjoy, but our favorite is the backyard garden area. It was awesome for dinner and drinks at night. It seems that Scott and Debra are avid cooks by the well stocked kitchen where we prepared our meals for Al fresco dining.  They have the best BBQ I have ever cooked on.

For the occasional times it was hot, the  ceiling fans and air conditioning were spot on.

This place is quality throughout."
11241369,414460941,2019-02-19,71666094,Guewon,Great place to stay. Space was exactly the same as described. Sarah sent me the guide on how to access. I definitely stay here again.

Basement entrance was right across from the garage door, so we could come and go as we pleased without worrying about being an inconvenience.  We went to Denver for a Broncos game and they were great to make sure we had enough warm clothes for the game. Close enough to the city, but not in a super crowded area.  Great first experience with AirBnb! We would definitely stay there again."
7359477,206509630,2017-10-25,85279653,Julia,Pleasant apartment in a good location. Quick drive from the LoHi neighborhood and not too far from downtown Denver. The only downside was a carport that may be a difficult fit for mid- to large-size SUVs.
33587935,470827668,2019-06-16,178092297,Hannah,"Beautiful little apartment, it felt very safe. I will definitely book with them again in the future."

25264683,512681516,2019-08-18,129146051,Idamarie,"Susan and Jon were lovely hosts to have. It was my first time with Airbnb so I was a little bit skeptical how this would work. Susan and Jon's place exceeded our expectations. The place was the right fit for my 6 y/o, my friend and myself. There is great lighting in the morning. Susan and Jon prepared the things mentioned on their profile page. The recommendations for food options were spot on! If you do stay with Susan and Jon, please support the local shops they recommend near them. And it was so nice to meet the cats, especially in the morning and late at night. The small details counted the most like the neat water glasses to the muffins - they were a hit! Susan is very personable and approachable. We had many great chats about her state and city.  I feel like we made a friend and hope to visit again really soon! Susan and Jon, in the little time that I have known you, you really are spectacular people. I wish you the best!"

15746223,159638419,2017-06-11,116006341,Cindi,"We really were pleased with the location.  Close enough to the city, highways and public transportation.  The area was quite with a family friendly feel.  The space is perfect for a short or long stay.  We were there for over a week and it was way better than staying in a hotel.   Highly recommend and would love to stay here again."

20902989,270909377,2018-05-30,129654029,Kayla,"I was a little bit hesitant about sharing a house with another couple. It ended up working out very well! I did not hear when they came or went, I had my own private space, and with the keypad door I never felt like my privacy would be an issue.  It is close enough to both downtown and the highway that no matter what you plan to do for the day it is easily accessible from this location. I also enjoyed not being in the heart of downtown. By being in a quiet neighborhood, I was able to sleep in and really enjoy my surroundings as well as the walk to downtown!"

It was close to Regis where my daughter is a student, close to downtown, and Tennyson eateries.  The place is well cared for with nice everything you need.  It was fun being up high and enjoying the view.  Aileen is a wonderful host, supplying fresh fruit and coffee for our arrival breakfast.  I highly recommend staying here!"
11554688,187870471,2017-08-27,9858688,Robert,"Super clean and newly remodel space. Downstairs but large windows let's light in.  Very quiet. Near shopping, food and walking distance to Infinity Park. "
25512427,534582106,2019-09-22,48624086,Melissa,What a great place to stay. They thought of everything that we needed. We plan to stay again.

236207,4730789,2013-05-22,1792960,Matt,"Dave was a great host, made sure I was oriented and had everything I needed.

The apartment is in an amazing location, close to a park for running/biking, restaurants and easy access to downtown via the free bus.

For business travelers it’s easy to access the convention center and beats most of the local hotels in my opinion.
"
14836832,160113917,2017-06-12,120118407,Jake,"Very quick response, and great location. I would book Ramon's home again. It is a little warm during days of summer, but it's not hot in Colorado often. Denver did have irregular warm weather the weekend I stayed."

I didn't sleep the best, my mattress is just too different at home, but the shows pressure and hot water were great! Like better than most any hotel I've been to. We left happy & ready to explore the city. "
14087278,129245511,2017-01-29,60383604,Brittney,"My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights. We absolutely loved the fact that we had a large attached/private bathroom to ourselves and a great, walkable location. The location is the best of both worlds- it’s on a quiet street, but around the corner are some of the best restaurants and bars, plus a short ~15 minute walk to LoDo (downtown/Union Station area). The room did have sparse furnishings as described, but the bed was comfortable and large (king?) and there were hangers in the empty closet which was convenient. It was nice to have our own balcony doors to open on sunny days. The balcony isn’t large enough to sit on, but it’s still nice to have access to. The room got a little chilly for my taste, but Jackie had a space heater in there that allows you to set your own temperature! At the time Jackie had one roommate staying downstairs who we only ran into briefly, but was super friendly and helpful. Jackie was great and very flexible with our check-in and check-out times. The house as a whole is kept clean, but if you’re allergic to cats like me, beware, because there is cat hair in the room. I shooed one cat off of our bathroom counter and by the time we left, all our clothes had cat hair. I know Jackie made a big effort to clean the hair (thank you!), but cat hair can act like glue. Overall I would recommend to someone who doesn’t mind cats, doesn’t mind a lack of nightstands, and who wants great location with a private bathroom."
20920706,228435367,2018-01-19,162833120,Wesley,The Sunflower Cottage is a great place to stay in Denver. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The host is incredibly hospitable and quick to respond to any questions. 10/10 would definitely visit again.
16217910,345708909,2018-11-05,157647931,Mckenzie,A great place to stay in a great location. Couldn’t of asked for anything better!
756594,107500538,2016-10-10,66800070,Leah,We had a great time at Ling and Chris'. The scones in the morning were delicious and everything was neat and tidy. There were plenty of clean linens and we loved the fruit and coffee. The house was in a cute neighborhood and about 15 minutes from downtown. Overall a very pleasant experience!

23858844,272555961,2018-06-03,153557997,Megan,"Well renovated house in an up and coming Denver neighborhood. Plenty of room, full sized kitchen, and very generous host. He gave us tips on places to eat, visit, and hike in Denver and he left snacks for us in the kitchen. 

Also, the house is ian good walking distance to many shops and restaurants, and then it’s just a quick drive across the highway to downtown. "
9486988,548044027,2019-10-16,37163436,Amber,Exactly as described. Perfect for an overnight stay.

Both days I had finished up and arrived back home he was out in the back yard playing fetch/throwing the frisbee for my pup!

He had tons of suggestions for where to eat/run/hike etc.  He pulled out a map and helped me locate the best routes of travel and was incredibly easy to talk to!  I definitely suggest staying here.  Great location, wonderful accommodations, comfortable bed, walking distance to restaurants/bars/coffee shops and a lake to run around.  Gary was awesome and I loved his sweet pup as well!"
33251421,486496432,2019-07-12,33687735,Zack,Definitely a cozy place! Host is accommodating and attentive. Would absolutely recommend!
6883917,100139715,2016-09-07,48533741,Jill,Ryan and Gloria were great. Responsive and gave recommendations when requested. The place was very clean and he provided fresh towels and a mint. Ryan made fresh bread for the morning and offered fruit and coffee. We were able to drop off our luggage earlier in the day before our actual check in time. 
15271643,170972113,2017-07-16,18091792,Pierre-Olivier,This is the place to be ! Location is very good for visiting Denver. David is a great and discrete host.
9471950,254936798,2018-04-18,56355425,Cyndie,"This place exceeded my expectations. The personal touches to everything make your stay feel welcomed from the beginning. 

The apartment is stocked with everything you may need and is on a quiet block. I loved the painted outdoor patio and the bed was very comfortable. Definitely a great stay for two. 

Location is two blocks from a market, and a 15 minute walk into downtown. 

Ps - I found it very helpful there was a water filter pitcher in the fridge. I forgot to pick up water from the market and this saved me :)"

10363495,199996637,2017-10-03,53571685,Andi,"The loft in highland is a perfect little getaway spot. Highland itself is a cute part of town; and the loft is tucked away in a quaint neighborhood, but is completely walk able to some awesome Denver spots such Recess Brewery, Williams and Graham and it is also very easy and cheap to catch an uber to downtown. The process for checking in was super easy, and the loft feels like it is private, as if it is it's own residence. The cleanliness level is immaculate and the beds were very comfortable. We came on a particularly rainy weekend, so we didn't get to use this feature, but Anne also provide bikes, which is a wonderful little perk and would be a wonderful way to explore Denver!"
4817072,196021997,2017-09-21,60218242,Sarah,Great little home walking distance to many great places and about a mile walk to downtown.  Perfect for our trip
19207597,273921696,2018-06-07,63179043,Kathryn,"The place was beautiful and immaculate. Perfect for 2 people, we loved the rooftop deck. We awoke at 8am one of the mornings of our stay to a few men on the roof installing a new skylight in the kitchen, which we were unaware about, but they were nice and left within a few hours. Loved the colors of the home!"
6913874,93127667,2016-08-11,7856737,Chris & Anthony,"The listing was accurate.  The bed was very comfortable!  The neighbourhood was very charming.  The neighbourhood allowed us to go to local restaurants and it was close enough to walk downtown (appx 2.5 miles) with stops at stores, museums, restaurants and gay and straight pubs along the way.  The bike station is right around the corner and Uber is everywhere!  "
15766497,254427207,2018-04-16,67523535,Jen,Great location!!! Pretty much walking distance to literally everything which was perfect for us. Jacob was a very helpful host. Will be back if we ever come back to Denver

17175955,427383555,2019-03-23,65358917,Kathryn,"This is an excellent house and I highly recommend it. We stayed for 12 days while my daughter recovered from surgery.  The house is nicely decorated, clean  and very comfortable.  We appreciated the nicely stocked kitchen and made good use of it.   The location is excellent and we found it easy to drive into downtown or the many restaurants on Pearl Street.   Check in was easy and Susan was an attentive host."
33805000,437574261,2019-04-14,191980225,Michelle,Rhonda was very quick to respond with anything I needed help with and she was very nice. Her home was clean and parking was on premises like promised.
19141160,327437539,2018-09-23,18692684,Tim,Stayed here as a launch pad for The Great American Beer Festival. 11 breweries within a 20 minute walk and a quick $7-8 Lyft into downtown. Nice to find the fridge stocked with some water bottles and snacks for those late night impulses! Thanks for the use of your place.
9474354,202081854,2017-10-09,54519094,Katelyn,"Perfect place to crash. Very close to dowtown, the park, and near a strip of bars amd restaurants."

Really easy to get to with public transportation. The bus stop is across the street. Late nite Lyft was reasonable. Zak even provided an airport run for a nominal fee.  Friendliness and convenience are the best parts, after Biscuit of course."

34600999,476691176,2019-06-26,110327046,Laura,"This was a great space for our family visiting Denver! The location is excellent. The house is in a very quaint residential area full of character. The home is a bungalow-style with cute front porch with swing - great place to enjoy a glass of wine! The neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet, but there are also many great area restaurants/bars to explore (recommending Zuni St Brewing Co and for the kids, Little Man Ice Cream!) It was easy access to the highways, and a 30-40 min drive to Boulder/Chautauqua Park area to hike the Flatirons.
The home has been newly renovated and everything was very clean and comfortable. The floor plan on first floor is very open with kitchen, family room and dining room together, which made an excellent gathering space. The bedding, pillows, towels etc were all high quality, which we appreciated very much after returning from a long day of hiking! The owners were attentive and have included many special touches, such as a variety of toiletries in bathroom for forgotten items, salt, pepper, oil in kitchen, plush throw blankets, memory foam for futon, etc. We enjoyed our stay here and I would book again in a heartbeat!"

39059018,556100836,2019-10-28,111662947,Robert,A great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. Within a short drive of multiple attractions and a great place to relax after a long day of exploring all the Denver area has to offer.

22936326,291366169,2018-07-15,14950579,Bill,"Baker is a great neighborhood and this condo makes it more enjoyable. We came here with 8 guys and had plenty of space. There was plenty of towels, and two bathrooms were very accommodating. Restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance. Everything fun to do in Denver is within a $10-$15 Uber. Would suggest for any large group or family."
11555808,110990475,2016-10-29,55320688,Maureen,"Thomas was very responsive to my texts prior to check in. His girlfriend was home when I arrived, and they let me check in earlier. She gave me a list of restaurants and breweries to check out in the area. Thomas and his girlfriend (and family) were incredibly friendly and helpful. The actual space is exactly as described. Super simple and easy. Close to downtown, friendly neighborhood. Within walking distance of many attractions and bars. Would love to come back!"
15060179,117243447,2016-12-05,6905111,Jessie,"We really enjoyed staying at this house. We had a group of 12 and everyone was able to sleep comfortably. While the house wasn't that large, it seemed spacious and did not feel cramped for the amount of people we had there. We thought it was in a very good location, just a short drive from downtown, but not stuck in the middle of the city. We loved being by the park and found some great spots to eat within walking distance. Mark's place was such a great value and we would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Denver!"
15807599,199632838,2017-10-02,114832766,Jeremiah,"This place is simply amazing.

I was here for a bachelor party (group of 11). We had plenty of room and definitely made use of the roof decks. We had all the amenities available for use as well. The views are nice and the location is convenient for heading into the city or going to sporting events. 

I would definitely recommend this house for vacation."

Access to and from the apartment was simple and secure. Mimi had printed out some great spots for coffee/food etc. and all were great recommendations. Will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Denver."

This place was easy to find and just a couple of blocks walk to restaurants and bars. Maureen was out of town the entire time we were there, but we had no trouble getting in.  She was very easy to get in contact with if we needed to. Maureen provided excellent details regarding entry, amenities, etc. We would definitely stay here again!"
6185753,273319737,2018-06-05,148854051,Steven,"Candace's place was great. The location is really convenient, close to parks and restaurants and a short walk from downtown. It's a good size and even on 90º days it stayed nice and cool. There was moderate morning traffic noise during my stay so for light sleepers that may be a little tough but I didn't find it to be a major problem, and since it's a basement there are lower ceilings so if you're over 6 feet tall that's something to be aware of. Overall it was a great stay!"
23325732,406179218,2019-01-28,232913287,Debbie,The house is verrry old but it’s a good location with cute updated decor.  Beds r super comfy!
11192056,156883837,2017-06-01,119845023,Maya,Stayed here for four days. It was a great location right in downtown Denver. Also so many stores and restaurants located within a 5 minute drive. The place was clean and decorated very nice. My favorite part about the entire place was the shower. The shower head and water pressure were amazing. I didn't want to get out of the shower. Haha. 
19207597,352086625,2018-11-24,64929574,Beth,Really convenient location in a wonderfully quiet neighborhood. Perfect location for a few days in Denver while visiting family. Easy checkin and checkout.

2232930,190668677,2017-09-04,145528337,Karl,Megan's place was very nice and clean. Super conveniently located to lots of restaurants and other attractions in downtown Denver. The back patio was very nice place to chill. Megan does not stay there while you are staying there but she is nearby should you need anything. I would stay there again if I am in Denver in the future.
17251698,162860451,2017-06-22,22921635,Wei,Great location for our trip! The apartment was clean and organized. Michael was very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommended!

It has a large backyard with a hammock and fire pit. The downstairs bedroom and bathroom are extremely nice as they appear to have been recently remodeled. The toilet seat even has a heater. I would book this place again in a heartbeat.
9883770,239408784,2018-03-01,174915402,Omar,Very affordable and a great location in Denver. Many different options for coffee and couldn’t asked for a cleaner place :)

19518864,273583995,2018-06-06,55483732,Lauren,"OVERALL: 5-Stars; STAY: 5 nights, 2 guests; REVIEW: Tess is a wonderful host with a wonderful home. Our stay in Denver for a conference was elevated thank to her hospitality and recommendations. Rooftop deck and patio made it easy to relax and unwind after a long day. The home is well-appointed with personal touches and amenities such as an espresso maker, wine fridge, fireplace, large television, and minor toiletries that you may have forgotten to pack. We were able to take advantage of some nearby festivals (eg, Chalk Art, Food Truck Rally, People's Fair). The home is near the heart of downtown and getting around is easy, either with ride-sharing, public transit, or walking. The area is definitely up-and-coming, but the home has safety features available and the group of town-homes is well secured behind locked gates. TL;DR: Well-situated home near cool areas of Denver, personal touches available for use (eg, umbrellas, sunscreen, minor toiletries), comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen, walkability to restaurants/bars, engaged host, easy check-in/check-out process"
24624885,510860455,2019-08-16,257877597,Brian,Nice suite accommodating in every way!

1792152,84657870,2016-07-08,77385714,Yasmeen,"I want to leave a good review, I really do. Rita is good natured but on the second night she told me that there was going to be a second guest in the bedroom next to me. I was shocked initially as I did not know who was going to be in since she told me while her friends were over and she did not respond to my text (even though she saw it). The last night I stayed there I had a very uncomfortable, uneasy feeling about sleeping over. From experience I've learned to trust my gut and I left quickly as I did not feel safe. There were no locks on the bedroom door or the bathroom which made me feel worse. I am glad I left. 

I tried discussing this with Rita over the phone but she kept on saying that she has had over 700 guests and no one has felt the same. The way she apologized was very condescending- she defended the man and said that he was a father and is married. While that may be very true, that does not change the fact that I felt unsafe. I got no refund for the last night spent and I believe this will be my last time using AirBnb unfortunately. "

15807599,131526445,2017-02-12,44524796,Robert,The house is amazing and great location.  Long walks to most or short rides away. Couldn't have asked for a better house for the weekend.  
15674568,291939912,2018-07-16,190556081,Taccara,"Travis is an amazing host that offered all sorts of thoughtful touches for our stay.  His communication was awesome as well and we always had a way to connect with him if we had any questions.

The location itself is super quiet and quaint and, if we didn’t have a conference to attend, Uber eats and Shipt made it easy to just relax and chill without having to leave. 

The ONLY negative to the spot was that it doesn’t have central AC and only ceiling fans. since it was summer, it wasn’t the most comfortable in the evening for me to sleep. 

All in all, it really was a great stay. "
10946289,530351620,2019-09-15,112520116,Allison,The house was great! The design is very well put together and the beds were really comfortable. Amazing water pressure for the shower and loved the kitchen. Great location for lots of restaurant options in close walking distance.

13751968,292691521,2018-07-18,5627460,Nathan,"Brook and Nadine were excellent hosts and provided such a pleasant stay for my girlfriend and I while in Denver. We arrived late on a Thursday only to realize the apartment did not have air conditioning. First of all, this was our fault because it clearly stated that their wasn’t AC, we just didn’t pay attention. Future guests make sure you read the entire description before booking if that will be an issue for you.  Brook had a large box fan and a large swamp cooler to help keep the temperature down which was very helpful. My girlfriend was having trouble staying cool but Brook at almost midnight Denver time was available for us, even suggested getting on the phone with us to help us through the issue. His compassion and willingness to help late on a weeknight was so appreciative, and we will forever be grateful for all him and Nadine did for us to make our stay better in Denver. Nadine was also very nice and gave us lots of tips around the area as to where we should eat or go drink. She even checked on us the next morning to make sure we were doing okay.

The location was perfect and was very close to the conference I was attending which was very helpful. We also felt very safe there even when we would leave the windows (on the first floor of the apartment) open at night and during the day while we were gone. All the amenities were great and there was plenty of room for just the two of us.

All in all we had a pleasant experience at Brook’s place and we would definitely recommend it to someone else!"
9731001,517768726,2019-08-25,13648986,Lisa,"It’s very convenient to go to the airport. Lots of stairs to the bedroom, but it didn’t bother us, clean. When arriving, it’s a bit challenging to find in the dark, but park in the side street and walk to the houses in the ‘inside.’ It was worth the knee and Timmy was quick to respond to me."

23611485,260398994,2018-05-04,177699185,David,"Kelly's cozy room was wonderdul and has everything needed after a long day out in Denver. Relaxing, comfortable, quiet, and an incredible value. It was a great way to experience the big city without being right in the middle of all the craziness."
833937,28554582,2015-03-26,13897138,Zoe,"We really enjoyed staying at Eliza's house. So good to stay somewhere with charm and personality! Our kids really loved the musical instruments (treated with care!) and we found getting around (no car) to be pretty easy using a combination of light-rail, bus and uber. Highly recommend the Science museum in City Park, the Art museum and the botanic gardens. 
Thanks Eliza! "
590,85833898,2016-07-13,82405417,Andrew,Jill was awesome! Very helpful and accommodating I would definitely stay with Jill again.

26661010,552529250,2019-10-21,64604749,Aditya,"Great location and a charming apartment. Keep in mind that there is no WiFi, as mentioned in the listing details. Unfortunately, the apartment was quite dirty when I was there, with quite a bit of dog hair on the beds and floor. Keep that in mind if you have asthma or allergies, plus it gets on your clothes and bags. Otherwise it was a nice experience."
8686305,368665120,2019-01-07,26587220,Amanda,"Billy and his family were outstanding hosts for the duration of our stay in their home. We received excellent recommendations for nearby activities, and the listing itself is in a great location for anyone visiting the CU medical campus. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and greatly appreciate Billy’s hospitality."

We really enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and Shelley has everything you’d need accessible in there! She has so many thoughtful touches as well like bags of popcorn, cold, fresh filtered water in the fridge upon arrival, plush bathrobes, and lots of local tidbits to make the most of your stay in the area. Shelley was also very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend!"

13751968,154679891,2017-05-25,38459831,Mark,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

I want to say this in all caps because I'm giving it a 4-star review.  As a place, though, it's spectacular.  Really nicely appointed, hip, exposed brick.  

It's got fast wifi, a great location, hot showers, and a powerful heater (important on those cold Denver nights).  And Nadine, who takes care of the place, is super responsive, friendly, and very helpful.

The one thing that made this place a little more difficult to stay in is, unfortunately, something fully beyond Brook's control.  Unfortunately, the next-door neighbors have a dog that insists on barking loudly whenever anyone is in the hallway, no matter the hour.  The walls are relatively thin in this building, which means you're awoken any time someone enters the front door of the building by the dog's barks.  This is probably fine for a night or two, but beware if you need uninterrupted sleep.

Still...a great place and I'll definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Denver"
21069884,425067898,2019-03-17,76429190,Wendi,Great space for a couple.  Seth is a great communicator and there were no surprises.  Highly recommend it!

3882739,224323164,2018-01-02,60071229,Natalie,"Staying at Nick's place was great! It was very well located-- walking distance to bars and markets. The apartment itself is very spacious for 4 people, with a fully stocked kitchen and nice touches as far as amenities. It was wonderful to have a washer and drier.

NIck is an amazing host (one of the best we have ever had). He made sure we were well taken care of and was always quick in responding to messages. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking to explore Denver. It is a cozy place to retreat to after a long day of sightseeing and adventuring."
11277311,284994551,2018-07-02,29730831,Julie,"Staying at Teddy’s place on Logan Street was awesome and I would totally do it again!   I was able to walk downtown everyday, enjoy popular neighborhood restaurants and cafes... and walk to Trader Joe’s for groceries. He left a pallet of water for me, the bed was comfy cozy with fast wi-fi and he accommodated me quickly on numerous requests and my last minute needs.  Julie (Florida)"

Their beautiful house is located in a great neighborhood, near plenty of restaurants, a few bars, and a yoga studio. They have great recommendations on things to do in Denver, I wish I had more time to do them all. The room is clean, spacious, and very accommodating. You can't ask for a better Airbnb experience - I was even able to book last minute! Thanks again Cal & Dave!! "

833937,34014078,2015-06-03,32784593,Sara,"5 Stars:  We really enjoyed staying at Eliza's.  It's a great pier-and-beam house with hardwood floors, plenty of windows, a nice relaxing back yard, comfortable bed, fully-stocked kitchen, a dining room table perfect for eating or spreading out metro maps (courtesy of Eliza), and very close to a metro stop that will take you quickly downtown.  Eliza was extremely responsive and thoughtful.  We plan on returning to Denver fairly often, and we hope to be able to stay at Eliza's each time."

4951295,245100774,2018-03-20,173281086,Kathryn,"The Nest had everything we needed for our trip to Colorado. The extra touches, such as the breakfast food and the detail restaurant list, were very helpful. It is located within walking distance of many great places. Parking was free and easy to find around the area. You did hear footsteps from above, but it wasn’t a huge deal. Gretchen and Jim were very accommodating and personally met us upon check-in to show us around the place. We couldn’t figure out how to use the pull out couch so written directions on how to pull it out might be helpful for the next guest. Definitely would stay at the Nest again. Thank you for such a great stay!"

Only issues: Bed was a little too firm for us, bath towels were a little hard, and washer did not work while we were there. Overall, it was an OK stay."

Hopefully next time the weather will cooperate and we can take advantage of her beautiful yard!

It was pretty hot in there to the point where I had to run out and get 2 fans at target but overall we had a good time and it was close enough to everything we wanted to get to!
9433028,129425848,2017-01-30,91922675,Cassie,This was perfect for a single person. It was a very short Uber to downtown. The people were kind and accommodating but give plenty of space to do your own thing. I would be happy to stay again and definitely recommend.

It is a super convenient location, great parking so you can walk everywhere in so many interesting directions.   Very comfortable apartment in nice quiet building.  Would definitely stay here again."

Malissa was extremely easy to communicate with before and during our stay which made check-in and out simple.  The location is ideal -  tons of fun restaurants and bars in walking distance and close to a B-Cycle station if you want to rent a bike to ride into downtown.  The option of waiving the cleaning fee was a great way to make this an affordable but still upscale place to stay.  Highly recommended, would definitely stay again!"

25195731,305001996,2018-08-10,139472258,Emily,"This place is very clean, tastefully updated and everything you would need in a rental house. Loved the renovations; added modern touches but kept the historic light fixtures, the brick, etc. I enjoyed how close I was to everything, located in a quiet street near downtown. I didn’t feel unsafe but I didn’t feel like I had much privacy in the front yard with people walking by quite frequently. Parking is on the street but didn’t prove to be an issue with me. There is a TV but just an antenna with a few local channels. Good WiFi so just watch your tablet but chrome cast would help. Good beds, good water pressure. Overall very good stay. "

Mark was good at checking in with us if we needed anything and left a binder with rules and guidelines for our stay.

The condo is equipt with all the appliances we needed. Aside from the obvious there was an iron and board, hairdryer, and cable. We were also able to make breakfast everyday before heading out to explore. 

A short drive to downtown Denver and an inexpensive Uber ride. Also about 40min away feom Boulder!

Do yourself a favor and book this great home for your trip!"

We've actually stayed at Lynne's for three separate trips and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. While in Denver, we're always on the hunt for fun breweries and new places to eat and there's no better place to do that than in Denver's RiNo neighborhood which is walking distance from Lynne's. Beyond the great location, Lynne's cute place is the perfect size for two and stocked with everything you could possibly need for a weekend getaway -  snacks, drinks, toiletries, the works. I forgot my toothbrush and there was a spare waiting! Staying at Lynne's feels like a second home to us and our two dogs and we can't wait to stay again. I couldn't recommend it more :)"

9273796,108633581,2016-10-16,56011062,Shaunda,"This was my first time with Air Bnb and I'm very pleased that I chose Bridget and Josh's home. The place was exactly like it was posted and they both made me feel very welcomed. As soon as I booked with them, Bridget sent me over a ton of recommendations to enjoy my trip. I went out there for a birthday getaway and on the day of my birthday they surprised me with a delicious cake and ice cream. (guys send me more of that ice cream lol). The location was pretty decent to public transportation and the neighborhood was quiet. I felt like I was at home. Bridget's taste with the decor is absolutely beautiful. And their adorable lovea ble fur babies was a delight, especially Ollie. Thanks again Bridget and Josh and I look forward to seeing you two again in the near future! :)"

The neighborhood was awesome and the location was amazing! Everything was amazing! It was beyond comfortable just a little cold but nothing a blanket can't solve.

Both she and her home ooze good energy. The neighborhood itself is also really cool and artsy with some good shops and restaurants right near by. Everything else in the city is super accessible from this location as well. Would recommend staying here 100% and would also love to come back some day :)

24868230,483758107,2019-07-07,52671502,Alexandra,This home was in a perfect neighborhood.  It is central to a wide variety of things. The house is much bigger than the pictures let on. It was great to hang out on the front porch after a busy day and just relax.  Perfect for families that want to stay somewhere peaceful.  Would definitely recommend to anyone and request to stay again.
9108143,59326452,2016-01-09,3417723,Laura,"We absolutely loved the Carriage House! It was the perfect place to stay while we reconnected with old friends and favourite places in Denver. The space is so thoughtfully equipped with all you need and so stylishly decorated throughout. I wish we had been able to stay longer to really enjoy the house to its full potential! I fully recommend this as a place to stay, and it was extremely family-friendly, too. Our two boys, four and two, loved staying in the room with two twin beds. Ashlee was very thoughtful and enquired ahead of time if we needed anything in particular for the kids. Everything about our stay and experience was wonderful--can't recommend it highly enough!"

5956309,559249999,2019-11-03,157679024,Brian,Bunk bed and bathroom was all I needed. The bedroom and bathroom were clean. It was close to where I wanted to be. The price and the rooms were on par with what I expected.
35284634,484296574,2019-07-08,62276577,Alexander,Everything was absolutely on point. Really enjoyed the space. It was nice to relax after long days in nature to come back to a little surround sound and movie. Bedroom was cozy and just enough daylight in the morning with the skylights. Great for a home base between good eating and great nature. Everything is well thought out and the details of the cottage are very classy. We’ll be reaching out to Benjamin again if we’re ever back in town.
30955430,417003174,2019-02-25,211734147,Fran,"This home was beautiful and perfect for my family to enjoy during the week leading up to our daughter's wedding.

Amazing photo opportunities too. A very special thanks to Hank for his quick response for any and all questions!"

21343580,218245563,2017-12-11,157254965,Samantha,"Zana was a great host! She left extra special touches for us including spare phone chargers for either iPhone or android, the most amazing coffee I've ever had, snacks and drinks upon arrival, all the necessities for the bathroom and she was always super quick to respond amongst many other great qualities that come with staying with her. There were five of us and we fit comfortably. I have not one complaint and only good things to say about being here especially if you want to be right in the heart of Denver. I highly recommend.

-Thanks Zana!"

17664945,152637506,2017-05-17,90008209,Sascha,Great place in a great neighborhood! Randall was the best host! It was great to have the place stocked with various snacks and amenities. There's several restaurants  just a short walk down the road. Downtown is a short drive away and it's easy to get an Uber if you don't have a car. 
14440882,103287496,2016-09-21,94837244,Tom,"What a find!!  From the time of our arrival to or departure, we were pampered and made to feel right at home!  Their prize-winning garden was like a little piece of paradise--a place to linger a little longer than planned.  We so enjoyed this hidden gem situated right in the middle of Denver, near City Park.  They provide all the amenities of a 5 star inn, but with their own personal touch at an affordable price.  We will not soon forget our lovely retreat at Rick and Terry's!  Thanks to them both!"
19065322,183245076,2017-08-16,41247199,Petter,My 3rd time here and I will keep coming back. Best service and location you can ask for!
13478248,253183705,2018-04-13,182341314,Russell,"This place is very stylish and a cool place to stay. Access to the garage parking space and the basement apartment being right next to the garage makes this a very convenient set up. If you compare Fred's place to any hotel, the hotels do not even come close to a good comparison. Fred's place is a much nicer place at a much better price than any hotel you will find in the downtown Denver area! 

It was very quiet and easy to get sound sleep over night, and I only heard a few noises of people living upstairs during the day time and it was not excessive at all. It did get a little chilly on my first night in the apartment, but once I fired up the space heaters it warmed up pretty quickly. To give you an idea of how well the space heaters worked, it was about 33 degrees outside and I had both space heaters on in the bedroom, and I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and had to turn one off, so they work very well.

Also, the bed and pillows are VERY comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
9296960,101176175,2016-09-12,87330067,Carla,A wonderful place to stay. Absolutely no problems even let us check in early. The kitchen and bathrooms are fully stocked and didn't need anything. I would recommend to anyone visiting Denver.
14980203,174695471,2017-07-26,55302311,Lily,We picked the place because it has two beds.

7131495,144374204,2017-04-15,121148308,Ben,"If you're just looking for a place to crash for as little as you can pay in Cheeseman Park's adjacent neighborhood and don't mind a little exposed ducting, air mattresses and a potentially noisy night of foot traffic above your head this will do nicely. "
10266757,101426869,2016-09-13,31994599,Kathryn,"We enjoyed our stay at Jim's clean, quiet and inviting space. Very comfortable bed and well appointed kitchen and bathroom. Nice to have a washer/dryer too. It's in an interesting historical area with restaurants, bars and city transportation within walking distance. One of our favorite restaurants in the area was Steuben's which Jim had listed in a guide book. Would love to have stayed longer!"
15271643,128656754,2017-01-26,41310577,Alejandro,A great place to stay. Close to pretty much everything in Downtown area. David is very nice and The place is fantasticly decorated and a great view of The City. I recommend it 100%
31085879,401957777,2019-01-16,10408586,Casey,Place was stylish and comfortable. The bed was a dream to sleep on. Easy access and no need to meet up in person to get keys.
9652984,327946009,2018-09-24,204820064,Brittney,"Mimi and John are fabulous hosts. Quick at answering should you have any questions. This location is amazing convenient, clean and just perfect for those spending some time in Denver. The bathroom / shower was so clean and a lot bigger than expected. The bed was super comfy. There is a mini fridge packed with local beers and some refreshments and some snacks to go with it. It was also nice to sit outside on the little enclosed porch to enjoy the beautiful Colorado weather. Overall, it was prefect for our trip to Denver - would highly recommend to all - we can’t wait to stay here again!"
13815789,125052730,2017-01-03,94637141,Kamilla,Great place to stay if you want to be close to downtown Denver. We loved the neighborhood and the surrounding areas. Matt was flexible with our check in/check out time. He was always willing to provide us with great recommendations and quickly responded to any inquiries that we had. We only wish that we could have stayed longer. 
14992777,532959184,2019-09-20,58427966,Elyse,"The location of Bank's place could not be better! I was going back and forth into downtown during my stay and transportation via uber was cheap and quick. The place is clean, and well-rennovated making for a very comfortable stay."
11482047,416470314,2019-02-24,36077574,John,"A great place to stay, about a half hour walk to downtown (and much faster if you're using a taxi, obviously)."

33251110,522795520,2019-09-02,55039889,Eva,"Very sweet hosts with an equally sweet and quiet dog we wouldn't have known was there if we hadn't seen her. Bed linens and our bathroom were nice and clean which are the most important parts for us, but I wouldn't call the common areas or the carpets sparkling clean. Maybe our timing was just bad, I know these folks work a lot. It was a good value and location and I would stay again, given the chance."
1309159,5650881,2013-07-09,7117350,Cori,"Joe is an absolutely delightful host. We had the pleasure of hanging out with him and some of his friends and the whole experience was a dream. The room was clean with really nice, soft sheets and towels. The mattress was brand new and amazingly comfortable (and probably very expensive). Great toiletries in the bathroom and a really neat cooling device that was perfect for cooling the room in an environmentally friendly way. The location was ideal and we highly recommend eating at Snooze if you get the chance. It did require a short drive so you would need a car. There are plenty of great places to eat in walking distance if you don't have a vehicle. Joe is a wealth of knowledge and took great care and time in providing us with many options for places to eat, places to drink, things to do, must see attractions, etc. He even made us a (Hidden by Airbnb) map!! His backyard is beautiful with a grill and bocce ball court and the place comes with a parking spot which was perfect for us. Joe is very kind, generous and conscientious. It's the little things that make or break an experience and his attention to detail was refreshing. Joe was our first Airbnb host and we could not have asked for a better experience. If I travel to Denver again (and I probably will) I will always stay with Joe if he can accommodate us!"
24429792,448950989,2019-05-05,247012593,Justin,You can't beat this lovely space. It's walkable to everything and Sarah is a great host. We loved it!

18891531,285050341,2018-07-02,56277022,Ceci,"Loved this cute cottage house! Great location in Denver. My fiance and I were in town to see a show at Red Rocks, and this house was less than 30 minutes away from the venue. The living space is small, but they furnished and designed everything so beautifully and thoughtfully that you don't even notice.  The bed is very nice and cozy - almost felt like a tempur-pedic mattress. 

Met Dave upon arrival, and he is very sweet and hospitable. Would definitely recommend to a friend."

14800540,213044490,2017-11-19,37988281,Katie,"What a gem! We stayed in Kathryn's place with our couple friends and just loved it. Her place is exactly as pictured/described, has all the amenities of a hotel (toiletries etc), easy to get around Denver/highlands area, and was super clean. Kathryn was such a great host, quick communication and was even kind enough to let us check out late. Would definitely book with her again! PS the entrance to the airbnb is on the side of the house, we missed it at first but other than that it's easy to find."

They were very quick with their responses, and street parking was available! My only complaint is that they turned the AC off when the left in the morning, approximately 6AM ish is when I noticed it. I get that AC can be expensive, but I didn’t have to be awake until 8AM so this was a bit annoying to me. Other than that, a great experience!"

915016,35776205,2015-06-22,29001524,Dan,"Tim and Cindy's Capital Hill apartment was a perfect place for us to comfortably stay while exploring Denver.  The apartment itself was clean, comfortable, charming, and had everything we would have needed (plus they offered to just ask if there was anything missing).  

We spent most of our stay out of the apartment exploring the surrounding neighborhoods and city,  and the location was perfect for that. Walkable to downtown and 16th St Mall, but also many great restaurants nearby in the neighborhood, as well as a whole foods just a couple of blocks from the apartment.

We had a late flight arrival into Denver, but had clear instructions from Tim & Cindy on how to get in when we arrived which made it easy.  They also allowed us to park behind their garage on a side street which was very handy when we had a rental car the last night and street parking was hard to come by later in the evening.

Had a great time and would stay again if back in town!"

3882739,109138025,2016-10-19,58034510,Kirsten,"This was a wonderful experience!! Nick was so helpful from the very beginning when we were trying to make the reservation. We were looking for some recommendations on where to go to plan our trip a little in advance. Along with what's listed already on his reservation page, he provided some great additional recommendations. Additionally, he was accessible and reached out to let us know that cleaning was completed and we could come by early. Also, he was completely understanding when my dad coincidentally showed up for one night. Further, he and his wife were super friendly and didn't make you feel like you were encroaching on their space at all, even if you were outside using the beautiful shared yard. The actual apartment was spacious, clean, comfortable, and had everything you could possibly need. Also, it was so nice how you can use the bikes, use spices and coffee in the pantry, and they even provided a few snacks for your convenience. All in all, I have to say that I hope this place is free whenever we visit Denver again otherwise we (me, my husband, and our two pups) will be very sad!! Thanks for the hospitality!!"

7091323,230963571,2018-01-29,26589893,Fang,This place was everything I looked forward to when I go to an airbnb. Me and my friends think it was the best airbnb host. Everything was super clean and cozy and definitely felt like home.  Everything was pretty close and we were happy with how close this airbnb is to an open-late dispensary.  My favorite part about the airbnb was the dog that we nicknamed PB. He was a wonderful dog during our stay and kept us company haha.

They are so nice and thoughtful, and they have prepared everything we may need. Especially we traveled with my 20-month little one, and we kind of a bit worried about her staying in an unfamiliar place. But Nancy prepared my baby with her granddaughter's toys and she loved them very much, which made her so happy. Overall, their place is nice, clean and convenient to all the sightseeing, and they are thoughtful, kind and knowledgeable. Hope I would have the chance to stay with them again."

A great attraction, in addition to the lovely interior, is the neighborhood.  It's a quiet residential area but minutes from shopping, restaurants or wherever you want to go in Denver.  A special attraction is its proximity to Washington Park which is listed as one of the top spaces in Denver to visit and I took advantage of that almost every day.  I had a rented car but you could probably do just as well with uber.  In addition, Paul was always available for a question if needed and even inquired about how I was feeling when I was a bit under the weather.  Thank you Paul for being a great host."

What they do have is lots of charm, and Samantha's place is certainly no exception with her stylish finishing touches. It was also in a super convenient location. Our commute to down town Denver for a conference was about 15 minutes on a busy Monday morning. "
24262468,303125427,2018-08-06,197584038,Jodi,We had a wonderful stay in an adorable room. Had everything you could need and more with some very nice touches. The girls were super nice and very accommodating .We wouldn't hesitate to visit again soon!!
21043300,354422873,2018-12-01,11002139,Nikki,Fantastic location—just around the corner from great shops and restaurants. Lovely house with all the amenities you need.
16361274,205265432,2017-10-21,153714844,Mason,"Robin’s place is wonderful, and she is a wonderful host! The space is plentiful, clean, and surprisingly peaceful and quiet. This was a great surprise to me considering how close it is in location to downtown Denver. There is also a really nice outdoor space/yard to hang out in. It’s also within walking distance to an up-and-coming hip area called “Tennyson Street”, where you can find cool shops, tasty restaurants, and some of the best coffee around. If you’re planning on visiting the tourist/nature destinations near the area, it is also in a great location for those, if you have a means of transportation. Robin offered some great local recommendations for food and entertainment, and seems to know the area very well! 10/10 would recommend"
23769761,445171182,2019-04-28,240229530,Arielle,Carol's place is great! It is centrally located to downtown Denver which makes walking to places very easy to do! Carol is VERY responsive and takes the time and effort to make sure you have a great stay.

1959918,45665164,2015-09-05,2100781,Alexa,"Mike was a great host - we had a little snafu with the cleaning scheduling but we got it figured out pretty quickly. Attentive and responsive, easy to work with. 

The space is nice and cozy, good space for 2 and could fit 3 if one doesn't mind the couch. No dog barking at all, and neighbor smoke smell not an issue as long as the air is circulating in the space. The A/C unit is a freestanding one that's situated in the bedroom. Not too loud and powerful though. 

It's a great location, just blocks away from the Cherry Creek Trail and the RTD light rail which can take you into several points of attraction. It's also close to a couple B-cycle stations which are great to see the city. 

Space is well-equipped with the essentials, and the laundry and shower work well. Great stay and I'd recommend it to anyone coming to Denver!"
19180922,550418827,2019-10-18,20164450,Jennifer,"This house is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the city of Denver. Steps away from plenty of amazing restaurants and bars, and a quick drive to downtown Denver, the convenience of the location is delightful. The hosts were quick to answer any questions (and respond to any problems), and laid out a wonderful welcome basket. We stayed as a group of six people with plenty of privacy and amenities. We would definitely stay here again!"
11191271,99111590,2016-09-03,56116701,Steve,Exceeded expectations. Chris was able to answer all questions we had.

We didn’t need much help with anything, but Amy and Jesse were a text or message away from anything. They also had a great binder with helpful tips and info on their space and surrounding areas listed from A-Z which was great! Can’t wait to stay again!"

26010149,325433010,2018-09-19,52011753,Alaina,"Monica went above and beyond for us.  We had a travel nightmare where our flight to Denver was cancelled and we weren't able to fly out until the next day, staying up all night in an airport fighting with the airline to help accomodate us.  Because of this, we missed our scheduled night at Monica's home and arrived in Denver the next morning exhausted and stressed out, and without a place to stay as we were going to need to travel quite a bit to our next destination.  While Airbnb was very understanding and made sure both parties were not penalized for the circumstances beyond our control, Monica was still kind enough to offer her home to us so that we could get some much needed sleep that afternoon before beginning our road trip.  I can't thank her enough for the kindness she showed us- it was a silver lining in an otherwise awful day."
24536074,495812494,2019-07-26,187713992,Zachary,"Everything was great. Central location, spotless, breakfast items provided, nice rooms. Can't go wrong"

9523086,201671589,2017-10-08,16102762,Lauren,"My friend and I stayed at Eric's for 3 nights, and wished we could have stayed longer! We were not renting a car, so the walkability of this spot was ideal. The bed is super comfortable, the town house is beautiful, and Eric made us feel at home. Thanks again!"

7359477,414776945,2019-02-20,70240274,Alanna,"My husband and I had high hopes for this place from the past reviews and pictures however were so disappointed when we arrived. The listing had no front picture of the house which is very run down and the neighborhood is not this bright neighborhood as described in the listing. The front door did not lock and could just be shoved open, the water did not go down in the shower, and there was dust on the floors and fans. We did not feel safe when we first arrived and tried to contact airbnb and the host saying we did not feel comfortable or safe staying in the house and neither were helpful and we were forced to stay their because we would lose all our money. I  strongly do not recommend this place as it is not what it is described."
13041992,179101522,2017-08-06,8439614,Paige,"So nice we stayed twice! 

We had the best time at Jack's shack. The apt was beautiful with high ceilings, exposed brick, and an awesome shower after a long day of traveling. Jack had drinks and snacks available to us in the room and made it very easy to come and go with the August App. There were fresh towels, shampoo and conditioner and the AC was a nice relief from the Denver heat!  The apt while not in the city center was perfectly located, with it being a $7-10 Uber to go out to the ball field, and many of the restaurants we were looking for.  Thank you so much Jack!"

15398641,266811526,2018-05-20,116993684,Lihan,I enjoyed my day in Scott’s house! Decent and comfortable with sufficient amenities. The hosts are nice and friendly. They even allowed me to check out at 2pm as nobody was checking in later the day I leave. The neighborhood looks safe and quiet. Pretty nice experience.

I got a ride with her roommate at 2:30am to get pizza when I got back late and no food was around. Would stay there again - convenient to get in from the airport on transit. I have an aversion to pet hair, of which there was some from her pup, but not much at all and the place was otherwise clean and had everything I needed. Really nice company, would stay again."
15469884,355341048,2018-12-03,83560264,Neisa,"Fantastic stay in this cozy space in the middle of LoHi! Location is close to bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation (if needed). Our host, Paige, was communicative and flexible when our plans changed last minute...couldn't have asked for a better location and Airbnb host. We will definitely stay here again when in Denver!"
27481744,568730118,2019-11-24,51428958,David,Stylish loft located in a great location. Easy check in. Great location to explore RiNo and also a 15 minute walk into LoDo and Union Station. I was also able to find free street parking everyday within a block of the Airbnb.

Brett was a fantastic host, making sure we had everything we needed.  The proximity to Wash Park was an added bonus, especially for our two little boys.  "
4638352,186468022,2017-08-24,49558603,Cole,"We loved our stay here! Our hosts were very friendly and quick to offer anything we needed, including great suggestions on what to do while here. The house and room were beautiful. The neighborhood is so convenient and has a lot to offer in terms of food and entertainment. One of our favorite things was driving around looking at the neighbor and all the great houses in it. The best part was definitely the door greeter Javi! We miss our dogs so much when we travel so that friendly face and woof made us feel at home."

22030436,435870831,2019-04-11,48236474,Natalie,"If you’re visiting Denver you must stay here! The plants are gorgeous, the natural light is amazing, and it’s very centrally located! As Amir mentions, there are 4 flights of stairs to get to the top but it’s well worth the view and gets easier each time! Do yourself a favor and book here, you won’t regret it."
4692525,28674376,2015-03-28,24053395,Veronica,"Absolutely perfect. John was an incredible host. He genuinely made me feel like I was at home. He's super understanding and was willing to accommodate things to my needs. I truly always felt safe and comfortable...John made my first Colorado experience even more beautiful, by allowing me to stay in a space free of worry, with an awesome cat. Thank you so much! I hope we can meet again next time I visit the mountains."
8686305,68409055,2016-04-04,26269990,John,"Billy's place exceeded all my expectations.  Perfect place for a downtown conference.  Far enough away from too much hustle and bustle.  Not far away from the airport either.  The space itself was modern and gorgeous.  Everything a traveler could need was on hand.  Clean and inviting.  Communication with Billy was easy and recommendations for restaurants was spot on.  Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, safe neighborhood with EASY access to the downtown, soccer stadium and all points Denver."
19441412,183959695,2017-08-18,28185293,Jacob,"The apartment was great, it's in a convenient location and has everything you could want from an AirBNB. On top of that Sheik was friendly, prompt and extremely helpful. I couldn't recommend this place enough."

The place was immaculately clean and just as pictured if not even better! The view of the city from the deck was gorgeous at night and having a garage was definitely a plus after the blizzard! Brian was a wonderful host that was quick to respond to any issues and had some great advice and suggestions as far as things to do while in the area! Thank you so much for such a great trip!

33454104,530487038,2019-09-15,131919309,Scott,"This place still seems to be BRAND new, so was a beautiful modern style place to stay in right in the heart of Denver. The location was incredible. Uber/Lyft rides would take no more than 10-15 minutes to get anywhere we needed to go. We were also able to walk to/from a lot of bars and restaurants as well. There were 5 actual beds, 2 of which were in a bunk bed format. The other beds were 3 single air mattresses and 2 queen/full air mattresses. Was a little tight trying to sleep 13 people, but we made it work. Just a note in case you are maxing the place out. Make sure you text if you need to get in touch, don't rely on email (just from my experience). Overall, definitely recommend this place for a larger group in Denver. Would definitely stay here again!"
9515084,142930860,2017-04-09,5553484,Shachar,"The place is located right by the 16th st mall, very central. The apartment is beautiful and clean, great for a couple visiting Denver for the first time. Highly recommended if you're staying downtown!"

The hosts allowed for late checkin and were very accommodating. The bed is firm (foam maybe) but comfortable. Pictures are accurate, it was very clean and they had a good hot shower. There was a Keriug coffee maker & coffee provided -wonderful for our early morning. We had a comfortable good night's sleep."
23060656,240342873,2018-03-04,154063405,Jonathan,"This place is amazing..and i mean amazing. The view while sitting in the hottub is amazing. I mean this place is like if someone took the best things imaginable and put it in this freaking bnb. The duel sinks are great, the bidet, the shower..yes a bidet. Theres a  hottub that feels like a dream massage. I mean really.  The roommates, cool as shit. Places to walk to...things to do...downtown Denver.  Im already booking a week in august. Stay here. Its amazing."

Things I loved:  Spacious, had everything I needed, nice jacuzzi, great internet, especially liked the third bedroom, downstairs in the basement, where it was pitch black.  Things that could have been a bit better: didnt expect the two floors (the rental and the owner) only being separated with a door, there was a clanking sound pretty consistently that imagine was old pipes.  Neither was really a problem at all.  Would definitely stay there again."
10266757,114326014,2016-11-17,58505047,Shinwey,We booked the room last minute and Jim's response time was incredibly fast. The instructions to access were clear. The room was clean and met our needs. Jim's carriage house is located near so many restaurants and bars that we probably didn't even need to rent a car.
26671030,556489726,2019-10-29,70270903,Steven,Very clean with great touches.  Quite comfortable and many amenities that I was not expecting.  Excellent communication with host.  Would stay there again in the future if given the chance.

There wasn't any stores within walking distance of there house, but were kind enough to take me to the store. They were very inviting and made my traveling experience more accommodating. It was very nice to have dinner with them and spend time with their family. There home was very clean and was the perfect place to stay overnight. The location was great for a quick car trip downtown and I was able to get directly there from the airport using the Denver public transit. "
23877844,438002347,2019-04-15,128323060,Julie,This was by far the BEST Airbnb I have ever stayed at!!! Stop looking now and book here. You will love every bit of your stay. Sarah was so hospitable and kind and the location was perfect.

Would love to stay here again."
29606917,429712473,2019-03-28,38856624,Sheetal,Tracey’s place was super cute and comfortable. Very conveniently located to Cheesman Park and the botanical gardens which are lovely. She had a key fob to allow us to enter the gardens since she is a member. Her place is Walkable or a short lyft ride into downtown. Check in was easy and communication was great. Tracey was flexible and let us check in early since we had an early flight. Only wish we had more time to stay here and spend in Denver.

23092127,318854067,2018-09-04,48961503,Kaitlyn,"Lizabeth is one of the best hosts I’ve ever had from AirBnB, and the space itself is ok. It is a basement apartment so be prepared for low ceilings (ducking under pipes and things if you are tall) and limited natural light. The layout is a bit strange: the entrance brings you straight into the bedroom and then into the living area. The “kitchenette” and single bathroom are both off of the bedroom and only accessible through the bedroom. For a single couple or a family, this probably wouldn’t be a problem, but since we had myself, my husband and another friend, it was a bit awkward. Also, the kitchenette is very small with a dorm-sized fridge, a microwave, toaster oven, and no sink. Despite some of these shortcomings, the place is located in a wonderful neighborhood, close to fantastic Italian food (Angelo’s), a great dispensary, and good places to grab a cold one. Downtown is a short Uber ride away. The backyard is wonderful, and the dogs are super great! Best of all: Lizabeth was a fantastic host! Communication was quick and easy; she was very welcoming; check-in was straightforward. All in all, a good stay!"
34867650,477633139,2019-06-28,270551623,Jared,Victor is absolutely fantastic! Great location near the airport and a very personable guy! Would definitely stay again!

629194,5483552,2013-07-02,2852775,Emily,"We found Juan's studio to be the perfect place for a young couple to stay.  The studio itself is spacious, private, extremely clean, well decorated and comfortable.  We felt at home right away.  There is the option to cook for yourself, if you want, as we did for most meals.  We were very happy with the location, it has a young vibe.  As my cousin (who lives within a mile of the studio) said, we were able to experience the ""real denver"" by staying in this location.  10 minutes walking can get you to a hip restaurant/bar scene or grocery store (sprouts is about a 10 min walk away down W 38th- like whole foods but seemed cheaper).  We chose to rent a car because our itinerary included a couple trips to boulder, so we didn't use public transit but there is a bus stop around the corner.   I would highly recommend this place to one person or a couple looking to feel like they live in Denver for a few days and aren't just tourists.  We would definitely stay here again!"
28131765,513549829,2019-08-19,73411630,Nora,"Very clean, nice amenities- (towels, soap, mini-fridge and microwave with several dishes) wall unit A/C, ample parking."
22149209,357597781,2018-12-10,128375157,Saja,"Jason, the host, definitely deserves the title of Superhost. From the moment we booked to the time we checked out, Jason was in constant communication with us. The house offers plenty of amenities and is a perfect place to enjoy with family and/or friends. Not to mention, you're helping out his non-profit as well!   We definitely plan on staying here again next time we're in Denver!"
10061459,448925735,2019-05-05,26362086,Elijah,"We spent a weekend in Denver for a Red Rocks concert. Emily’s place is in a great location between the rocks and downtown, super easy car access and a sparkling clean comfortable king size bed. Everything we could ask for and an affordable pricing!"
21662868,212193234,2017-11-16,118551881,Brenna,I can say you won't be disappointed with your stay here. Great place not far from the airport. Jason was very welcoming and a spectacular host. He offered to give you a tour around the town even drive you to the airport if you need it. Only thing I wish we could of stayed longer. On my list as a place to stay if i find myself in the area!
24334427,402201720,2019-01-17,225548609,Scott,if your coming to denver. Joey's is a place to stay
31473307,493603667,2019-07-22,249863161,Jen,Great kitchen and bathroom. Only thing in the bedrooms is that there is no where to put clothes except a closet. Would have been nice to put our clothes away. The house was a great spot in town and they gave us great suggestions on where to go and see interesting sites and restaurants. Had a great time.
13789731,334986919,2018-10-10,3400328,Rick,Great spot

13744375,185797698,2017-08-22,15618216,Rachel,Was a 15 minute drive to many of the places we visited in Denver. Had some difficulty finding the location.
4236002,28565488,2015-03-26,4139972,Oliver,"We enjoyed our stay from the first to the last minute. The apartment is perfect, more as described. Nichole and JB are very, very nice hosts, with great familiar charisma and great sense of humor. The neighboorhood is quiet, nice and safe. You find a car park any time, right in front of the main house. Next time in Denver, we book Park Hill Carriage House again."

15872243,218024183,2017-12-10,79735132,Tricia,Very quick response times! Was my first time using Air B&B and Javier worked with me helping me understand the process. The home was spotless and so spacious! Loved the off street parking and comfortable beds and completely quiet neighborhood!!! Much better than a hotel and much more affordable than a two room hotel stay not to mention this home closer to Western Complex and any hotels we found!!! Very Impressed!
6357426,55562760,2015-12-02,42061660,Nick,I loved renting this apartment from Carrie! She was very accommodating and it exceeded my expectations.  The apartment is in a perfect spot in downtown with everything walking distance away!  
8427693,90409633,2016-08-01,54935639,Lexcie,"What a fantastic stay! Their house was in such a cute area with a lot of great local businesses around it, and it was close to downtown. We go to Denver every year in the summer, and until now we've been staying in hotels, which cost way more than this Airbnb did, and the hotels were always so far from anything fun. It was great to have our own private bathroom and bedroom, and the coffee every day from Cherry Bean was amazing! Very clean space, and the bed was so comfortable. Got a few recommendations on things to from Our hosts, which were great. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to others and we look forward to coming back!"
22407753,404348928,2019-01-23,86975772,Anna,"Definitely the basement of the owner's home and not the most private, but a beautiful space with lovely hosts."
39405,68829009,2016-04-07,2750903,Jack,"Comically small apartment, uncomfortable bed, and not super clean.  I recommend staying here only if it's a bargain - like $60 or less.  I paid over $100 a night and was very disappointed.  (Even though the hosts were lovely and the location very convenient.)  

Everything in this apartment is in miniature - which is not clear from the photos.  There is no real couch.  There is no room in the bathroom to towel off.  (I had to do so by the front door.)  The doorways are low, so if you are over 6' you will have to duck.  The TV is a tiny old unit tucked away on a bookshelf in the corner.  And the only place to sit comfortably is at a tiny folding table in front of the bathroom.  

The bed is hard and uncomfortable.  It is a simple foam mattress sitting on a piece of plywood, supported by a large wooden box. It slept more like a cot.  I felt like I was camping.  

On the plus side, the location was excellent.  The garden outside was rustic but inviting.  Parking was easy, and the drive to downtown was just a few minutes.  Jennifer and Gio were warm, friendly, and easy to communicate with.  Unfortunately, these positives were outweighed by the negatives. This was a disappointing stay."
24575556,314323980,2018-08-26,19168019,Chris,Nice place for a large group. 
15802190,482649170,2019-07-06,80762937,Sara,Such a beautiful home in a great location. Loved walking to get very good coffee and strolling through the park each morning!
11192056,93622454,2016-08-13,9834702,Tesia,"Kinga was super sweet and her place is adorable. We loved the baroque style and enjoyed having the roof deck access. We ordered food from Kinga's Lounge below, and it was delicious. Do take note of Kinga's mention about the noise-level that goes along with being over top of a bar (especially on weekends, including Thurs evening). It was fine for us, as we're city dwellers ourselves and used to a certain amount of noise, but it might not work for everyone."
23684531,463039531,2019-06-02,164067713,Max,"Laura and Nader offer a unique, creative and welcoming space in a vibrant part of Denver. It is a great place to unwind at the end of the day, is close to a wide variety of attractions in the Santa Fe Arts District, and is a 15 minute walk to downtown. I definitely plan to book this space again when I'm in Denver."
12765811,487130784,2019-07-13,257059304,Henry,"My wife and I had a great time staying at the gypsy, and it was the perfect place for us as we transitioned out to live in the Denver area.  Joel was quick in his replies when we had questions.  We recommend staying here!"

33587661,459700440,2019-05-27,221926549,Lexi,"the place was great, close to downtown and just off the main roads. the staff was so pleasant and went above and beyond to make sure I had a good stay. the only downfall was that it could be noisy at night, especially being so close to the Fillmore Auditorium. But overall it was great and I/ would definitely recommend!"
9169151,278724149,2018-06-18,113917395,Mat,This place is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone looking to be located close to downtown but still feel relaxed. I love that you are able to smoke weed in the apartment. I don’t drive and the uber/lyft prices were always reasonable. I plan on coming back!
23946544,312550645,2018-08-23,153814262,Colleen,Great location!   Very clean!  Noisy due to construction in area and tenants above us. No shades in living room.  No toaster that we could find.  
9010867,268711380,2018-05-25,47250781,Tom,Very nice place. Exactly as described.  Definitely would stay again.

First, Tanya is very kind, and communications are prompt, clear, and easy. 
Second, Tanya's home is lovely, clean,  and in a neighborhood that seems safe, is attractive, and close to many activities.

Her place was conveniently located that walking downtown was a breeze and an easy uber ride back if needed. We appreciated the little touches Julie had to the home and our stay was very comfortable. We went away for a girls weekend, this home was perfect! Thanks Julie for letting us stay in your amazing home! "

17022504,456895231,2019-05-22,21337279,Emily,"Ryan's apartment is better than the pictures! Really lovely, spacious home. Ryan was super easy to communicate with and made check-in easy. He was nice enough to allow me to drop my bags off before the check-in time. About a 12 minute walk/4 minute drive to the heart of Rino."
14043521,234455733,2018-02-12,60440740,Daniel,This home is a great option for anyone looking for a quiet and modern home to relax in Denver. The neighborhood has great restaurants just blocks away too
27419666,533421721,2019-09-21,67274997,Heather,"I am not exaggerating when I say our stay was perfect at this home. The apartment is very roomy, and a perfect size for my family of 4. Every amenity we could need was already in the home. So many blankets and pillows for comfort, cozy furniture, a full kitchen and washer and dryer. There are tons of board games and even a small library! And the fenced back yard is the highlight. Pristine grass, flowers and veggies growing all around. My kids enjoyed that so much.  The neighborhood is beautiful, safe and clean as well. There is a fire station nearby, but we didn't hear sirens inside of the house at all. So don't let that deter you from this beautiful home. So grateful that we found this place, we will be returning again and again!"

21897185,231145644,2018-01-30,118774190,Hannah,"First time doing airbnb. Let me tell you. This place is in a great location. Private downstairs. Best price for value with having your own shower, bathroom, etc. There's no kitchen. That's okay. There is a fridge. They were quick to answer any questions I had and give recommendations of nearby attractions.
It was an awesome experience and I highly recommend staying here.

7515713,51290269,2015-10-19,531900,Katie,"About the house/area: As a former Denverite, we were super excited to stay in Sam's home. She has a killer LoHi location in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to some great shops and restaurants. Not familiar with the area? No biggie - Sam provided a great guide book of favorite spots in the neighborhood. On top of that, the home itself exceeded ALL expectations. Sam has obviously invested in creating a one-of-a-kind home and we should all feel very fortunate she shares it with others! From the AMAZING view of downtown on the rooftop patio (oh, and a hot tub) to the super cozy basement with a huge screen + movie projector, you could easily spend your entire trip just relaxing in the house and have a great time. Honestly, if we hadn't been in town for a birthday party, we probably would have done just that.

About Sam: Sam is a sweetheart! It was my BF's birthday and she left him a card + cupcakes - a gesture that was very much appreciated! She has gone out of her way to provide guests with a detailed guide book of the neighborhood + helpful hints about the home itself, which has some amazing tech features. Sam was a great host and was super responsive when I had questions. In fact, a few hours after we checked out I realized I had left my computer bag on the couch. She responded to my text immediately and I had it back within 20 minutes. (Crisis averted!)

Bottom line: If you're contemplating Sam's AirBnB, stop it. JUST BOOK IT. You will be glad you did!"

The house itself was perfect. It was clean, cozy, and the special touches made our stay extra special. We felt right at home. The chickens are fun and the recommendation books were helpful. The location was great for making it to the downtown area and the mountains! Next time we are in Denver we will definitely stay here again!"

From walking into the house that looks exactly like the pictures if not nicer to walking into the dope 420 Zen Room equipped with all your smoking essentials, extra toiletries in case you forgot one or a few, to the extra towels, clean linen and pillows. The house looks small from the outside but you walk in and it's VERY spacious and clean. Bella her dog is shy but a sweetheart. DaNelle made sure to make my birthday trip extra special and for that she has a new family member lol and loyal guest for life! Her communication and attention to detail makes her a great host! So if it's available DON'T pass it up!! Im glad I didn't :)"

37915830,535177773,2019-09-23,197147488,Ameryss,Place is OKAY for a desperate night stay. House smells of cigarette smoke and sewer. Room is in the basement.  Bed I slept on was broken on the left side and you could feel the bed sink in when you laid on it. My friend woke up with a sore back. Looked under the bed and the frame was broken. This should be fixed immediately when the stay costs $70 a night

There were some lights not working when I arrived and one call to Fred (who was out of town) and the problem was fixed. I would definitely stay there again. "
22612423,468544144,2019-06-12,41851128,Rosie,This apartment was meticulously clean and curated with stylish decor.

10015153,537500831,2019-09-28,150199936,Luis,"Fantastic location, really kind host and smooth check-in. You'll have everything you need. The space is located in the basement. You'll hear the train passing by during the night, which was a plus for me! The space was perfect for my one-week stay. Lovely patio."
17387231,218437114,2017-12-12,159018102,Francisco,Taylors house was in a active area of Denver. There is a lot of things to do within walking distance. I would recommend  this location if your looking for the Denver night life.

Her description is completely true of the space, there were no surprises. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay and a better host!"
31899142,435159568,2019-04-09,196528189,Ravy,"The place was really nice and convenient location. The only one thing that we don't like about is to hear the typical noises from the upstairs, like walking, doors opening."

Made seeing denver too easy.

Can't wait to stay here again!"
16392236,459661798,2019-05-27,3610593,Cheryl,Great location and cute house with everything you need.  We stayed here for my little sister's bachelorette party and had a great time.  The arrangements were a little tight with 10 girls sharing two bathrooms (to be expected!) but we made it work and it was nice to all be together as opposed to staying in a hotel.  Nothing was more than a short walk or uber ride away.  The Hosts were super helpful and responsive.
36868885,531505477,2019-09-17,6654511,Meg,"Great location, easily walkable to lots of cute restaurants."
23452346,508302850,2019-08-12,67570281,Erin,"Michelle and Stephen's place was perfect for three women on a trip together. Stephen was attentive to our needs and very friendly; he introduced himself to us and asked if we needed anything during our stay. He also gave us a late check out with no extra charge after we inquired about it. 10/10 hospitality, would highly recommend!"
24748184,538518430,2019-09-29,131224563,Sue,Daniel was great with timeliness and thorough with directions as I arrived  late - so appreciated!

My boyfriend and I stayed in the corner bedroom, most comfortable bed EVER!!!  Her house is very artsy and different and the town is great! Everything is walking distance and she gives you a lot of ideas of what to do around there. Also if you're a 420 enthusiastic there is a dispensary pretty close, maybe like a 10 minute walk. After visiting Denver we are both now considering moving down❤️❤️"
10494162,65429366,2016-03-13,61520605,Brianna,"The guest house was so cute, just like the pictures!  Wished we could have stayed longer but it was perfect for a business trip stay. Wes was great about working with our weird schedule and late arrival. I would recommend this place greatly! "

15831072,197142304,2017-09-24,133590077,Jordan,Writing the book on hosting! We did not want for anything and the space was very clean and comfortable. The location was close enough for a long walk to our destination at the Fillmore and uber downtown was cheap. Kelsey and her family are respectful of space and messaged to ask before coming down to say hello. Great experience for our first time in Denver.
852934,552908413,2019-10-22,168100653,Jessica,We loved the cozy MCM look and feel of the Artist Oasis!  Responses were very speedy and we appreciated letting us check in earlier than expected.  Would recommend/)

22305207,567836058,2019-11-23,4764489,Cristin,"I cannot speak highly enough of Tyler's place.  We (four of us) rented it for use as a retreat from the hectic schedules which can make up a conference. Tyler anticipated so many of our needs that all we really needed to do was add food and drink - almost everything else was taken care of.  The house is beautifully restored and comfortable with these lovely touches that make it unique and special.  I can see why there is such high demand for the space as it is not only gorgeous, but well located and easy to get around from.  Every time we learn we've got business in Denver, we are definitely renting here.  Thank you!"

37045509,528217208,2019-09-12,25260007,Dr Jack,"Gorgeous $million townhouse. Elegant, tasteful furnishings...even a Hermann Miller chair.  Great decks off the great room and roof.  Easy access to garage.  It was so beautiful that it inspired me to treat it better than my own home.  Everything worked, including the WiFi and Apple TV.  His suggestions for morning coffee and restaurants were spot on!  Thanks, Joshua. "

Upon arrival we found a bunch of goodies laid out for us with a note advising us to fun. This attention to detail, and the amenities in Lawrence’s place really elevated our experience. The place oozed with good vibes making us feel right at home! Not to mention it’s proximity to EVERYTHING! Highly, highly recommend booking this place. Lawrence really set the bar high!"

4263714,242698281,2018-03-12,132038436,Heather,Melissa and John were great hosts! They made us feel extremely welcome during our 2 night stay at their home and shared some great tips about food and entertainment in the city with us. Great location for a nice and relaxing stay with easy convenience to the city and transportation.
8671797,85428368,2016-07-11,20744515,Ronda,"Rachel was a wonderful host and communicated well before our arrival. The Carriage House was exactly as described and more than what we would have expected. It was comfortable, well-furnished and had plenty of room for 2 people. The weather was quite hot while we were in Denver and surprisingly, Rachel left us plenty of bottled water already chilled in the refrigerator! A wonderful place to stay for any visit to Denver. We will definitely be returning!"
14058998,531098200,2019-09-16,104481978,Angela,Jackie's house is beautiful and centrally located. Everything was a quick Lyft ride away. The neighborhood Jackie lives in is also filled with cafes and restaurants. Jackie was super helpful and provided us with a detailed list of places to see.
18275427,540541321,2019-10-03,93221169,Laurie,A comfortable quiet space in a versatile location. Appreciated the  cleanliness amenities and a cozy bed to sleep in!
21026144,467690808,2019-06-10,253523617,Michael,"It's a wonderful house, in a great location, owned by a lovely person, in an increasingly great city, for an affordable price. That said, staying in someone's house while they are there has it's drawbacks when one is on vacation. That is the only issue we had, obviously not the host's fault, just an observation in regard to the impression of a stay for four nights."

27583000,446061224,2019-04-30,33396428,Jenny,"Bekele was very responsive and kind. The apartment was quite spacious and comfortable. It worked out great for our family's needs. If you're expecting a 5 star hotel it was a little rough around the edges where the finishing is concerned, but we thought it was great. With a few minor touches it would've been perfect (ie, softer toilet paper, hooks in the bathroom, bathroom floor mats, kitchen towel). We would certainly recommend his appt to others!"
13901522,402515107,2019-01-18,35012182,Henry,"This was my second stay with Danielle, so I knew what to expect.  Great host with a comfortable space. Loved the new bed and the shower was great! Everything is very clean. Danielle is very nice and accommodating."
19828479,481966314,2019-07-05,93941873,Greg,"Marks cottage is a newly renovated carriage house, with modern and clean furnishings and renovation. The location across from Lake Berkeley was great for walking mornings and evenings, or running or cycling. It is also a walkable distance to Tennyson Street where you can find a good variety of coffee shops and dining. It’s location right off I 70 also makes for easy access to the mountains of Rocky Mount national Park and travel along the front Range of the Rocky Mountains."

Not a single negative thing to say about this stay! Thank you for having us!! "

12454119,162856691,2017-06-22,76253770,Amy,"Our first AirBNB experience was totally worth it! Free street parking was easy to come by, the space was clean and comfortable...what a delightful stay! The neighborhood was beautiful with the most adorable bungalows one after the other. David was totally organized with the welcome binder with stuff like instructions on how to use the remotes. Seriously, why would anyone stay in a hotel anymore with this kind of customer service? I hope we have more AirBNB stays like this in the future in new places."
38205605,536008703,2019-09-25,36239314,John,"Great spot and a fantastic price! Brian was a friendly host who I got to chat with a few times, and was very responsive through messages in the app. The bed's a bit on the firm side, which didn't bother me in the least, but I thought I'd mention it in case these sorts of things are important to some people. Highly recommended!"
16548314,354395955,2018-12-01,35867194,Megan,Tomas’ place is incredible! The pictures do not do it justice. The place is very unique with plenty of thoughtful touches. Tomas is also a wonderful and friendly host.
915016,411238674,2019-02-11,72617576,Devin,PLACE WAS AWESOME THANK You!
16733876,315769518,2018-08-29,131700062,Kaylee,"This basement apartment pretty much met my expectations except for a couple of issues. It was simple, clean, had a bed, tv, and comfy sofa. The tv was a bit old, and had a dark line going through the screen but was still usable. Also, the fridge wasn’t working but the hostess did offer a mini fridge to use in its place, which was nice but it did kinda ruin my plans to buy frozen and refrigerated groceries. Another issue I had was I received a ticket for parking on the side of the street because they apparently do street sweeping every 4th Thursday of the month. I wish the hostess warned me ahead of time so I could have avoided the $50 fee. In summary, her place was okay and served its purpose for my trip."
22928612,442058021,2019-04-22,39981081,Hannah,"Wonderful hospitality and a unique, memorable place to stay. Very comfortable space. We enjoyed the architecture and Larry the dog. The welcome banana bread was very thoughtful and delicious!"

25369287,269634223,2018-05-27,51945676,Mark,"What a find!!! This is a new listing and am I glad I found it! It's a large one-bedroom on the main floor of an old Victorian house in the super-hip LoHi neighborhood of Denver. In addition to the bedroom, there's a living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom. Also a sweet front porch where you can sit outside. Everything is clean and nice, they've obviously put a lot of care into making this a great spot. The interactions were all easy and smooth. The neighborhood is amazing. Within easy walking distance are a Kombucha bar, coffee shops and lots of restaurants (the best is Duo). There's a pedestrian bridge over the highway so you can walk to LoDo, another great neighborhood with REI, Union Station, and tons of shops and restaurants. This is a great Air BNB in a great part of Denver."
15425189,158656612,2017-06-07,73991338,Sara,This is a perfect place to stay to see all of Denver. Easy check-in and super clean!

The inside was everything we expected, I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking.   "
23960099,327312295,2018-09-23,116267481,Joseph,"Willow's AirBnB was such a great stay - would stay here again if I ever come back to Denver.

Willow was a great communicator and was accommodating to our 3-person reservation. Of course, everything was in order just as described in the description and pictures, and Willow even went above and beyond by providing us a delicious quiche and coffee for breakfast!

The location itself is great; very walkable to spots downtown, and beautiful to walk out to the capital every morning.

All in all, this was one of my best AirBnB experiences to date!"
25141789,452258318,2019-05-12,121195587,Ross,Darek & Kayla are Great Host! They were so responsive from the booking process through check-out. I asked a question about an ironing board and the next thing you know they went out and bought a high quality board. Their home made our family of 6 feel as we were home with quality amenities. Great Neighborhood with many restaurants and micro brews pubs!
32985397,565549422,2019-11-17,27745308,Joel,"Jane’s place is absolutely stunning—even better than the pictures suggest. The huge, antique windows allow for tons of beautiful daylight to pouring in the unit and the open concept kitchen makes for a conducive environment. Great decor and tons of room to spread out comfortably. Also has a sizable back porch with gorgeous sunset views. I’ll definitely be staying here again next time I’m in Denver."
27267320,540051347,2019-10-02,46455060,Fenway21,Obviously walking I to someone else’s house to stay but truly had that feel. A bit awkward.
15800346,210467399,2017-11-09,38094375,Carol,"Quiet, clean, near restaurants in The Highland.  Nice and warm on a chilly evening. Parking easy, check in painless.

Overall the experience was absolutely phenomenal, only good things to say for the trip, thank you Jacob!"
21463028,459761551,2019-05-27,160440361,Zak,"This place was a great place to stay. We had 5 people in our group so the three bathrooms and multiple bedrooms were great for us. 
The bedrooms besides the loft were all a good size and had very comfortable beds. 
The temperature in the upstairs loft forced us to turn down the air conditioning really low in an attempt to cool it down. It didn’t really help that much so I wouldn’t recommend using it if you can. 
The communication at all times was amazing! We had a very smooth check in and response time on any communication was always prompt. 
The neighborhood wasn’t the best, but lot of the best places in Rino were a quick ride away which helped. Downtown wasn’t much farther. We tried the taco place up the street and enjoyed their food, but be real careful with their hot sauce. 
Overall a good stay."

30395033,436661435,2019-04-13,192600923,Allison,"My husband and I traveled to Denver with another couple and stayed at this spot for a week.  Having two bedrooms with a king size bed in each, and 2 full bathrooms, was a huge plus and definitely sold us on this place for our AirBnB stay!  The check in and check out was easy and seamless.  The communication from Darren before, during, and after visit was consistent and courteous.  The house was clean and tidy upon arrival; the kitchen was stocked with all the necessities to make a ‘home-cooked’ meal and the BBQ grill in the backyard came in handy too!  There was plenty of toilet paper, towels, and extra bedding on hand.  The washer and dryer in the basement was another plus; neighborhood was quiet, even with the house being off a main road; public buses run right off the street; house is close to food and retail spots; the zoo is literally around the corner; backyard was clean, private and fenced in.  If and when we come back to Denver, we will definitely stay here again if it’s available!"
4545539,309154744,2018-08-17,201641461,James,Great place to stay and Tyler communicated well. 
16522375,160078401,2017-06-12,89049183,Brandi,"This place was great! It really met all of our needs perfectly! Myself, my wife and another couple used this space and it was perfect for the four of us, even quite spacious! Emma was always incredibly responsive both leading up to the trip and during our stay which was greatly appreciated! It came in handy especially when the apartment randomly lost power one morning. We figured out there was an outage in the area but Emma let us know she was contacting neighbors and the power company. She even gave us a small refund to cover the inconvenience which was unnecessary but so generous!

The space was clean, had a fully stocked kitchen, huge bathroom, and wonderful little balcony. 

Two things I will say is that if you bring a car, the parking spot provided is pretty small, so if you have a larger vehicle it might be a challenge (but there is street parking). Another is that although there is no smoking in this space, the downstairs neighbors appeared to be partaking in marijuana use which smelled up the stairwells a bit. Luckily it was super minimal in our space, but something to be aware of. 

Overall I would DEFINITELY stay here again and would highly recommend it!"
18023988,448991109,2019-05-05,91188228,Eric,This was perfect for our weekend in Denver.  Super easy check-in and easy to get around every where.

28431563,450983298,2019-05-10,231828933,Danielle,"Josh and Jess’s place is beautiful, spacious, and quiet. It is in the perfect area with easy access to I-25 or walking distance to anything in downtown. Don’t hesitate staying here!"
11336016,138825421,2017-03-21,112726768,Isaac,Great place with lots of charm. The patio is beautiful and great to have a drink on. Sally was wonderful and helpful. The only thing was the shower is a little rough -- hot one minute and cold the next with minimal water pressure. But the location is more we could ever ask for! Uber's are cheap enough to just about anywhere ( $7-8) and able to walk to multiple restaurants from her place. 
23457396,333842506,2018-10-07,20566200,Nelliana,"My friends and I (8 people in total) who were going to Denver for a wedding chose this house for the modern/clean/open feel. The pictures do not do it justice. It was an absolute dream to stay in such a lovely home. The neighborhood was sweet and with local transportation and walking, we were in easy distance of pretty much every place we wanted to go to, and yet still have a nice quiet area to retreat to at the end of the day.

With eight people, it never felt crowded or cramped. The beds were deliciously soft, which absolutely led to us all sleeping in both days we were there. 

We've all agreed that we would want to rent this house again asap when we come back to Denver for a trip."
7070674,472968796,2019-06-20,220705018,Leslie,"Excellent location for visiting our DU student, very clean and comfortable place, loved having the park so close for morning walks!  Absolutely would return. Excellent, fast communication too with the host."

31116813,469512671,2019-06-14,4992766,Ashley,"A very cute place to stay. Loved that there was a kitchen that included hot plate, toaster oven, microwave and full sized fridge. The place stayed very cool and the bedding was comfortable. The only downside is if you are a light sleeper. I’d suggest earplugs because you can definitely hear everything from the floor above. There are quiet hours which helps. Otherwise the place was great and there are good restaurants you can even walk too"
4294257,160153787,2017-06-12,48440235,Jennifer,"Perfect place to stay! Walking distance to several bars, restaurants and a great brewery. "

14239172,324711910,2018-09-17,68330582,Kd,"Sarah was an excellent host. The apartment was very clean, easy to navigate, and centrally located in a quiet neighborhood walking distance from grocery stores, coffee, and restaurants. Came with everything you need for a long weekend, including a fresh bar of soap! Cool decor and easy check-in/check-out. 10/10 do recommend."
34498478,553223161,2019-10-23,58595099,Colin,Michelle's place was great for exploring the city and for having a nice clean place to crash when you were done.

26328157,341368163,2018-10-26,9742362,Christopher,"Great space in an up and coming area. Cool basement with poker table and bar area. Main floor is stylish and decorative. The bed is very comfortable and has a high linen count, which is important to me.  Very nice setup overall. Nice place to rest your head and see the rest of Denver."
15817834,293675593,2018-07-20,140637905,Abby,"We were only at Ashley's place for one night before catching an early flight, but we enjoyed our short time here. The space was comfortable and very clean. The enormous bathroom was wonderful! I would definitely recommend Ashley's place."
7497461,150677399,2017-05-08,2120818,Megan,"Carly's place was in a good spot, only about a 25 minute walk from downtown — but very conveniently placed in one of Denver's best neighborhoods (the Highlands!). Check in was simple and she accommodated some last minute requests. Would recommend though I do wish she would just include the additional hospitality tax in her original price (even though she is awesome and transparent about it, it did make for additional steps that didn't feel fully necessary). Thank you Carly!"

8366762,160132632,2017-06-12,126654908,Emryl,"Excellent location if you want to be right downtown. Close to restaurants and bars. Easy access in and out of building, and private back patio."
13494022,252675527,2018-04-11,173315400,Jose,Excellent communication with great privacy. Very clean and beautiful townhome. Wil highly recommend this location to friends if they need to go to Denver.
27828755,359686106,2018-12-17,58705943,Marcy,Place is very spacious but not a warm homey feel. More like a motel/hotel sparsely furnished place.  The location is fabulous and for us was within walking distance to our kids so perfect. Beds are comfortable. Apartment is clean.
19391528,463086579,2019-06-02,20629197,Michael,"Comfy place in very convenient location, easy walk to the convention center and downtown area. Just the basics but had everything I needed."
21853722,464873832,2019-06-06,49675337,Michelle,"Michelle's place is my home away from home.  As a frequent business traveler, staying in a hotel gets pretty rough.  I now have a place in  Denver that I can call home and recharge.  Her space is comfortable, sparkling clean has all the amenities that someone who is on the road most of the month could want (washer & dryer along with fully stocked kitchen)."
21321438,239436742,2018-03-01,165860738,Megan,Perfect location and the space is beautiful

12002460,252908443,2018-04-12,36380769,Arlene,"As this was my first experience using Air B and B I didn't know what to expect and have no real basis of comparison.  The location was perfect for us.  The room was large, clean and comfortable (great bed). (Should I mention the adorable toilet seat cover with yellow duckies). I was confused about the price of the room.   Listing said $75 per night and Air B and B charged $85.  ?? Didn't challenge it. Becky was a lovely hostess and I would gladly stay there again"
26253523,293107238,2018-07-19,192049137,Patty,"We came to Bill & Rita’s place for a local getaway and loved everything about it. Lovely space that exceeded our expectations, including thoughtful touches like upscale amenities, books, games, a fully equipped kitchen and truly gorgeous linens and decor that made us feel right at home. Onsite hosts were extremely communicative, available when needed but otherwise left us in quiet privacy. Terrific outdoor area with beautiful garden and walking distance to the excellent restaurants and shops on Tennyson Street. We can’t wait to return! Patty & Chris"
21796586,470903001,2019-06-16,3702084,Ryan,"Alicia and Josh have done an incredible job of fitting out their space.  It was extremely clean, tidy, and well designed.  They were very accommodating of our travel needs, including flexible arrival and departure times.  I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Denver."
1785877,8919909,2013-11-25,3606972,Michael,"Cynthia is a great host and loves finding ways to build community among her guests. The dinner conversations have been particularly enjoyable and engaging. In terms of the accommodations, they're ""spot on"" with what I was looking for in terms of accessibility to downtown. Her rooms are comfy, clean and simple. I endorse her venue with the highest of recommendations."

12365447,177700705,2017-08-03,12224309,Reginald,One of the best places I've ever stayed. To many finishes to list. My dad loved sitting outside and looking into the garden. Oh and thanks again Patrick Snooze was awesome. If you go get the shrimp and grits

He really made me feel welcome! The room is simple and straightforward, well kept and comfortable. Great location and a good value."
1900638,62706451,2016-02-16,34201564,Michelle,"Beyond welcoming and accommodating...treats you like part of the family.  Goes out of her way to have everything available that you might possibly need, including water, snacks, coffee, tea, juice, and toiletries that you might have forgotten.  Wonderful safe neighborhood just blocks from DU.  Comfortable bed and bedding.  She does have a dog, but is careful to keep the dog in certain areas of the house, not near the guest room.  It was a lovely experience...thank you Barbara!  I hope to come again."
25477072,345313339,2018-11-04,21462347,Weber,LaMark is a great host. He was very attentive. He had tea and coffee for us in the mornings if we wanted it. He even bought donuts the day we were leaving to offer to us for breakfast. Very accommodating and laid back. Would recommend it!!
8718728,210320007,2017-11-08,39083719,Kendall,"Rachel's home is the perfect spot to come home to relax after exploring Denver!  I definitely recommend getting a massage from Rachel while you're there. It is so convenient and a nice treat. The room was a little small but the bed was very comfortable. My boyfriend and I never spent too much time in the room but it's a cute, cozy spot to come home to after a fun day!"

13447168,126174110,2017-01-09,1510379,Christina,"Judy & Marty's place was absolutely perfect for a weekend in Denver. Our flight got in early the day of check in and they were very accommodating and let us check in way before check in time. If you forgot something they had extras of everything. It definitely felt like a home away from home! 

"
665622,27721947,2015-03-10,19916694,Rebecca,"This has been the second time that we've stayed here and we absolutely love it every time! It's cozy, comfortable and clean and has everything you could need for your stay. It's with-in a short walk to some really great restaurants, bars, ice cream and shopping. Our out of town guests that stayed with us were very impressed with the location and amenities. 
-Until next time! Thank you!"
13972526,522101245,2019-09-01,51585475,Brandy,Karina and John were great! We were able to use their grill and loved their backyard! They also let us use anything in the cabinets and fridge as well as coffee which was really nice. They were in the basement but we forgot they were there as they were very respectful of our privacy and had a different entrance as well. We enjoyed our stay very much and it was perfect for a weekend at red rocks!
1069351,9461465,2013-12-30,9196911,Antoinette,"The bungalow was perfect for our family -- cozy and homey, with just enough space for everyone to feel like they had their own space.  The backyard is beautiful, the kitchen fully-equipped, and the neighborhood is so convenient to major streets and downtown.  We loved our stay and would return again without hesitation!"
4227772,73346203,2016-05-08,16725373,Justin,"Lynne's place was absolutely perfect! It was a really great location and she had a bunch of tips for where we should spend our time around the area. The place was so cute and cozy.

Also, the shower head was tall enough! I'm 6' so most Airbnb's I've stayed in have had shower heads low enough that I have to duck/crouch a bit in the shower. This one was just right."

Having private access to the basement worked out great for us because there was plenty of space - when my mom went to bed early, I was able to stay up in the living room area. The location was perfect and Denver was beautiful, as always :)"
16406440,361834584,2018-12-24,22906482,Michael,"Sara's place was great for our one night stay. 1 bathroom for 7 people was a bit inconvenient, but for the price, it was all that we could ask for. The space was nice made for a cozy space for my friends and I to hang out. The basement is an underrated space to hangout for some board games or beer!"
24748184,430075954,2019-03-29,98724038,Leah,Such a cute place to stay and the location is perfect for anything you want to do in the Denver area!

22032668,347681306,2018-11-11,36230751,Megan,"Had an enjoyable stay at Chad and Susan's.  The apartment was just as described and the photos are accurate.  A little noisy during brunch time with the restaurant next door and the pull-out bed wasn't the most comfortable, but the place was clean and well-appointed and the keyless entry was easy to use.  I would definitely stay there again."
26007543,336823677,2018-10-14,30013701,Lihuen,"Lana's place is amazing! I love the decor and the beautiful plants everywhere. The room was perfect for our weekend trip. Check in was a breeze. Location was great. House was very clean! 

My only complaint is that the grey cat is too adorable. I am allergic to cats and I couldn't help but snuggle him. 

10/10 would recommend!"
10494162,345245528,2018-11-04,216277449,Ashly,"To all who are considering Wes' Air BNB, 
The spot was cute and quaint, and fit our needs for the short trip we very much enjoyed! Wes took time to send a full list of recommendations and he was spot on with the places he suggested to visit. Everything is a short Uber/Lyft ride away and is very affordable with the ""pool"" option offered.  
All the best & hope you enjoy as much as we did!"

Parking was easy, which made it even better. Would def recommend this home to stay next time your in Seattle. And I wish they could design my home, their decor is so beautiful! "
13041992,504472950,2019-08-07,280731491,Alexis,"This Airbnb is super cute with tons of character. Check in was a breeze and Jack was very welcoming and let us come and go in the space as needed without feeling intrusive. Parking is right out front and the location of the apartment is convenient. Adorable room with a gorgeous claw tub and exposed brick. If you are looking in this area, this is a great option to stay!"

14593779,319528322,2018-09-06,12332246,Paul,"Chuck and Jordan have successfully nailed a perfect rental property!  They are warm, inviting, lovely people who are generous with their space and support during your stay. I have very high expectations being in the hospitality industry, considering the space and location this property exceeded my expectations.  This property is perched almost on top of a small hill that happens to be one of the highest elevations in a large surrounding area.  The views just from the living space are of the city lights with the rocky mountains off in the distance. Do yourselves a favor and take  a walk to the top of the hill and get a great view and photo opp.  I hope everyone can enjoy the rockies and denver as much as we did.  
Thank you!

8606580,540057792,2019-10-02,983570,Bruna,Josh was an excellent host and very quick to respond to our messages! This Airbnb was extremely comfortable and clean. I highly recommend it!
9710417,192086126,2017-09-09,22985475,Mandy,"We stayed here from Wednesday to Saturday. The place was easy to find and check-in was a breeze. This is a little carriage house in the backyard of Anna's house. Don't be alarmed by the lack of AC, the cooling system they had worked fine and we even had to turn it down because we got chilly. I appreciated all of the notes throughout the house as well; they were really helpful to figure out how to work the TV and all that. My only recommendation - get a Brita pitcher so people can refill and filter the tap water! :)"
26564570,353130581,2018-11-26,141762973,Amy,"The Carriage House is lovely! 
Staying there was a great experience, like being in a home away from home. Theresa is such a gracious host. And the location is unbeatable. 
We will certainly look for this booking again, when next in Denver."
21730063,275776679,2018-06-11,4834261,Aslan,"I live in downtown Denver but I had to find a temporary accommodation for  a couple nights. I booked this room which was a nice spot to hold out until work was finished at my pad. It’s a really nice house, a welcome escape from the little space you get downtown, definitely safe, and Peter is a stand up guy. There are electronic locks  on every door the house had an incredibly clean interior. I only wish I could keep my place that clean! All in all, I really enjoyed my stay away from Downtown and I thank Peter for accommodating me for my temporary exile from downtown Denver, lol."
15098428,195755295,2017-09-20,543964,Audrey,"While Cecelia was always there to help us via the phone, Alex was on site and is probably the coolest guy in the neighborhood. I was kind of sad I had to work the entire time, because hanging out with Alex in their beautiful backyard was one of the best breaks I had during the project. Go Broncos! Not only that, but the place is fantastic, a real AirBnB treat with all the fixings for a relaxing, enjoyable time. I would definitely come back!"

10237203,239935529,2018-03-03,173058697,Arika,We enjoyed our stay!! Enjoyed the privacy we had. Didn’t even meet the host. I’m kind of introverted so I loved that. Great place. Great hospitality!
24746875,285436106,2018-07-03,115816847,Tiffany,"Zach's place is near the Denver zoo and the Coor's stadium. 30 mins to red rocks. 10 to downtown...I mean you couldn't ask for a better location. Family with 3 small kids. Zach let us use the beautiful outdoor area to let the kids run, small park 5 min walk, and a bathtub (good for kids). Beds are comfortable. So clean and comfortable. Cute furnishings. So much light for a basement apartment. Would recommend to anyone!"

The home was close to downtown Denver and that was very convenient.  It is a great place for a couple or 2 couples to stay and enjoy time in Denver, for sure.  "
9169151,541054361,2019-10-04,236561955,Kaitlyn,"They were very welcoming and very pleasant to speak with! They gave me all the things I needed from how to get in then places to go while there.

1454673,173108964,2017-07-22,137272927,Julie,"This place was GREAT!! It felt more like a Bed & Breakfast than most other homes on Airbnb. The location is pretty central, only a mile or two from downtown Denver, but far enough that it doesn't feel too crowded or noisy. The host is super great at communication and making sure you have everything you might need. They include a lot of little things that add to an already wonderful experience! I would highly recommend this host and home! I would definitely stay here again should I find myself in Denver in the future. "

We were able to cook meals, walk our dogs in the lovely neighborhood parks, enjoy relaxing on the patio and just feel like home away from home. Cheryl, Chris and the family have a lovely attitude and spirit about them. We felt relaxed and very happy with them. I would highly recommend The Carriage House in Stapleton for anyone's stay. No regrets.  Looks just like the photos and feels wonderful!  Thank you for everything, you made our first three weeks here in Colorado a joy. 
Ida, Robert and Pups. "
13474217,129705410,2017-02-01,73738650,Gregg,"Beautiful residence and great communication. The entire process was smooth. I would say the location isn't exactly walking distance to most things, but that should not definitely not deter you as it is a very very short Uber to everything you could want in LoDo Denver. "
18582812,179040100,2017-08-06,8616536,Joshua,"Mark's place is in a great location, very clean, lots of light, and really comfortable beds!  Mark is a responsive host and the check-in/check-out process was very easy to navigate.  Would highly recommend."

12986223,86726153,2016-07-17,63879935,Jayson,"Brian was very nice and accommodating. Before we even arrived he even went out of his way to suggest places to go and particular trails to hike. The home was very clean and he even had an XBOX! The location was better than we thought. There is Sloan's Lake caddy corner from the stop sign in front, lot's of restaurants with 2 minutes, dispensaries, and bars to try. I loved that the neighborhood was full of young active people biking and running and 5 minutes from downtown.  We were mainly focused on experiencing trails in Colorado and found all 4 with 35 minutes. Brian even extended our stay at a discount. One of best experiences with Airbnb, and no question,  Brian is the reason for that. I would book my next stay with him if available!"
23388648,420432205,2019-03-06,128550543,Hen,Sasha was a great host and the unit was amazing. Super close to downtown & it has everything you need. Would highly recommend.

16165056,155769978,2017-05-28,42476737,Ryan,"Nice updated home very close to the city. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had everything you could need to be comfortable including a fridge, coffee pot, snacks, and water. Only thing we would have preferred was a lock on the bedroom and bathroom doors. Also bummed we didn't get to meet the dog that everyone seems to have fallen in love with! Would highly recommend staying here!"
2467260,200488508,2017-10-05,46898447,Christina,"One of the best I've had the pleasure staying at. Ryan was very helpful throughout the entire stay. His suite is very sweet indeed. It's stacked with all your needs, quite but close to so much. The suite has so much personality and very comfortable to call home for a few days. Check out Ryan's binder of places to go that are close and local. There are several great finds in here. If this place is free, book it fast and enjoy your stay. PS: Denver biscuit Co is not to be missed and just a short walk."

24159249,360210672,2018-12-19,224059734,Zarious,Staying in this home helped make my birthday a great trip. It was our first time in Denver and we will definitely be back just based on the home alone!! The guest before us trashed the place and they way the cleaning crew turned it around we never would have known. I definitely recommend!!!!! The only heads up is if you have never stayed in a townhome then be prepared to walk up and down stairs but it’s s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) worth it!!!!!
16739250,164302822,2017-06-26,134562377,Amanda,Kimberly was a nice host and she came and picked me up from the airport when I missed my flight.  She even provided me with a bathrobe and a sleep shirt because I didn't have my luggage.

11690656,475122544,2019-06-23,257243418,Diego,Great place. It's near pretty much everything we wanted to be in Denver. Was a great time.
142683,472878357,2019-06-20,265454198,Samantha,Nancy’s place was great and exactly as she described! Great location! Close to restaurants/cafes and city park! I got up ever morning and went for a run in the park. Everything about it was easy and convenient. I would stay there again.
4895802,280183876,2018-06-22,156726413,Amanda,"Amazing location!
We ended up walking 5-10 miles a day because it was so much more fun to explore that way (and we didn’t have to deal with city parking). You will be able to walk to coffee/donut shops, restaurants, wine bars, gastropubs, and breweries. Great for both families and singles.
This is a great jumping off point to explore both the trend Highlands neighborhood, as well as lower downtown. There is a beautiful trail along the Platte River w/in walking distance for your morning jog. Our kids loved to splash around in Confluence Park.
It overlooks the freeway so it is very noisy when you open the windows, but they do a good job of shutting out the noise when closed. Bring a sound machine if you’re a light sleeper. ;)
The kitchen was nice to have, but we ended up never using it because here were so many amazing restaurants to try nearby. 
We would definitely stay here again; where else  can you walk to get vegan ice cream at midnight?"
34342338,450527831,2019-05-09,84416872,Preston,"I had an incredible experience at John and Janell’s place.

676825,159310215,2017-06-10,9870578,Michael,"Krista's house was perfect for our stay in Denver. The Stapleton neighbhorhood is close to everything, but feels secluded. Lots of parks within walking distance. The house is very comfortable and well appointed. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay! The only thing we'd wished we'd remembered to pack was our kids scooters as there were lots of nearby urban trails that would have been fun to explore more."
37088734,531916230,2019-09-18,135422708,Trenton,Carly is very responsive and proactive in contacting guests. We enjoyed our time in Denver and the neighborhood and nearby park were great.

It's a really nice and comfortable space and she has so many amenities set up for her guests. I really like the neighborhood, parking was easy, and her cat is so friendly!  It's as private or as open as you prefer and I would definitely stay again - with pleasure!  Also, if you want fish and chips, GB fish and chips right up the street was awesome - also try the Shepard's Pie!"
787456,201702109,2017-10-08,124657068,Bj,Pam and Brad are wonderfully kind people. Staying with them is my first choice for my trips to Denver! Perfect for me in so many ways!

7912052,95575386,2016-08-20,51381332,Joanna,"What a great experience!  Aki and Hiroko were incredibly welcoming, thoughtful, and kind hosts.  My friend and I brought our sons to Denver (9, 11) who thought they hit the jackpot with all the games, large screen TV and the wonderful breakfast bagel spread. Hiroko gave us advice on what to do to entertain the boys and we were so glad we took her advice. We hit water world and the aquarium.  I can only hope I make guests feel as welcome as Aki and Hiroko made us feel!

39405,63409115,2016-02-22,1154648,Hannah,"We had a very nice stay at the Mulberry Cottage! The hot tub was our favorite part! I'm so glad we brought our bikes, which was great for getting around downtown, but I probably wouldn't recommend walking there. It is farther than most people would probably want to walk. There's some great places in the neighborhood within walking distance to eat and drink. Very cute cottage, the pictures actually made it look a bit bigger than it actually was, but it was not a problem, nice and cozy for a weekend getaway."
29132612,422131317,2019-03-10,18922010,Troy,Very convenient location and nice spot if you're attending a conference at Gaylord Resort.

29335867,522214401,2019-09-01,244949453,Max,"My wife and I absolutely enjoyed our time in Suzie’s place. It is the perfect size for one or two couples or a small family with a couple of small kids. The couch and bed are extremely comfortable. The kitchen is perfect, we were able to cook some meals. Also, we had no issue with getting food delivered to the house. Ride shares showed up with a couple of minutes each time, the location is also great for getting out in your own vehicle. There is plenty of parking on the driveway. The outside space in the back is perfect, we never once felt like we didn’t have privacy but also did not feel like we were claustrophobic. Lots of lighting and places to sit in the back deck/yard. There was also a small rabbit that visited us in every evening as well. Hopefully Suzie’s place will be available the next time we go to Denver, because we will definitely stay there again."
16589595,287143915,2018-07-07,4872465,Lydia,A really convenient place to stay if before heading to the Denver Airport! Tiela and Dan were really communicative and the space is quiet and comfortable.

I was excited to stay at a place that pictured beautiful touches, but seeing the interior in person proved that the photos did not do justice. it was all so thoughtfully put together when remodelled. If I could chose all of the features of a new home I would definitely chose a lot of the finishes used here. it was a very relaxing space."

It also is very close to restaurants, bars, shopping and other necessities. I loved having a washer/dryer available and a sunny outdoor space to unwind after a busy day.

After the Light Rail train we spent over an hour trying to get to the house, which was completely our own fault. As we checked in a littler later, Eric greeted us kindly. In terms of proximity to everything, it's all down the street, which ever direction you go. As for the actual room, like I said in the beginning, AMAZING. Amy has literally everythinggg you need. It's sooo private and really cool. I've never been in a basement, now I want one! Big restroom, with the hottest water I've ever experienced! Also, upon arrival Eric explained the ""In and Out"" tags by the door, take notice and use. Enjoy!"

22336069,299778080,2018-07-31,9153201,Jenny,"Good value and good location, but lack of sunlight and unpleasant odor in the entire unit will prevent us from staying here again."
7919653,270162048,2018-05-28,50837532,Nick,Colleen's home is gorgeous as well as having a great location.  Everywhere we wanted to go was within 10 minutes.  We went to Central Market as well as Rockies game.  She was a very hospitable host.  I would recommend this place to anyone going to Denver.

23455554,337277184,2018-10-15,198074826,Megan,"My family and I stayed at Don's place in Denver a couple weeks ago. Everything was perfect from the minute we got there. When we arrived, we met Lizzie, who gave a tour  and showed us where to find everything we would need for our stay. She was great and we loved that she was there to give us the tour. Don's place was beautiful and extremely clean. We enjoyed the garage access. Especially since it snowed one day we were there. We would definitely stay here again when visiting my brother in Denver! Thanks Don!"
8071897,355328611,2018-12-03,62930881,Leigh,Great location.  It’s a downstairs unit with private entrance. Everything was clean and easy to find. Erica and Brianna are great communicators and all of the instructions are easy to follow. Street parking is easy if you have a car. We had a ton of privacy and it was a great base for our long weekend in Denver.
24633836,312080735,2018-08-22,48719113,Sarah,"We really enjoyed our stay at Taylor's place - the location is convenient to downtown and public transportation, the gated courtyard is fun, and the bed is comfortable. A nice alternative to an overpriced hotel room."
17462656,141575225,2017-04-03,99104438,Tim,"This place is great for a long weekend stay over with friends and plenty of room for 2-3.   Cozy and well designed, we loved the kitchen as well as the small patio outback to relax between day trips. Mary was a great and accommodating hostess.  "
17240910,207749370,2017-10-29,25520357,Jason,Another great stay! This little place was perfect for my 3 day business trip - just the right size! Steven and Susan are some of the best hosts I’ve stayed with and are always my first choice when a Denver trip is planned. Thanks again!
26281251,554636414,2019-10-26,11559579,Angie,"Conor's place was exactly what is pictured. It was the perfect place for our first visit to Denver. Great location, clean, stylish, and plenty big for 4 adults and 2 small kids."
2072132,186865285,2017-08-25,12255079,Janis,"Jessica and Carl were extremely nice hosts. They made us feel welcome any time we met them, were always up for a chat and helped us with all our questions.

Very much recommended!"

17071293,241824060,2018-03-10,39759274,Kevin,Scott's place is awesome. We stayed here at the beginning and the end of our spring break in Colorado. Both rooms had king size beds and everything was super clean. The balcony was great for smoking outdoors and there was some cereal for bnb guests in the morning. I'll stay here again next time I'm in Denver!
4227772,201689128,2017-10-08,4058197,Lori,"No problems! Fast communication, incredibly accommodating, and a very clean space - just as described!  Completely fenced in yard was a bonus as we needed to bring our dog at the last minute."
18843560,341699998,2018-10-27,80414443,Tj,"Not the most private or quiet place and, as others have mentioned, the cat presence is pretty strong.  If you are allergic I would definitely not recommend. That said it's a good value and great location and was perfect for my needs.  Its a neat little space and super friendly hosts.   My favorite brewery in Denver is a short walk away so that's a plus!"
14962389,243386614,2018-03-15,100547111,Brannden,This place. Make it your bachelor party getaway. It was clean and open and we loved the project screen as well as the pool table! Had plenty of space to relax and get cozy if you have a bunch of people definitely rent this space 100%

5500958,227709014,2018-01-15,57699657,Paola,"Casey was very responsive from the beginning of us booking our trip. Check-in was very simple. Casey’s apt is located on the second floor of a building that holds 3 other apartments. Parking pass included in the welcome binder. Walking distance to many places in downtown. It was also easy to catch Uber or Lyft in the area. We really did appreciate the comfortable beds, clean bathroom and towels."
14741480,318864428,2018-09-04,208239712,Ashley,This is an amazing home. It’s less than 10 minutes from downtown and the amenities superb. This home has a beautiful backyard and nice sitting area. Our host was extremely accommodating since we had a very early arrived time and we were able to check in early. Next time we go to Denver hopefully we can stay here again. Thanks again from Florida!

548897,30801784,2015-04-27,1771461,Carolyn,"This is a fantastic little apartment in a cool, interesting part of Denver. The apartment itself has everything that you could need: privacy, a comfortable bed, dresser and shower. It is just blocks away from great restaurants (I particularly recommend Pinche Taquería, Vine Brewery and Max's Greek Diner). It is also in walkable distance to the Botanic Gardens which is a must see. Heather was a great host, we didn't meet her personally but she was instantly responsive when I had questions about the wi-fi (we fixed it) and the parking space located on property. Thanks for a great experience Heather!"
5619534,481392365,2019-07-04,232767724,Emily,Host expects guests to take care of ferrell cat. This would have been good to know since I have a cat allergy. We had to cut out trip off early since there was a problem with a family of raccoons living in the house.
18410407,564356929,2019-11-15,39289071,Blaine & Charity,Great property and was exactly as expected and as pictured. We had a large group there and everyone was very comfortable.
38108112,530483124,2019-09-15,49877838,Bob,Wonderful location and great open spaces for the group. The bathroom situation was the only downside but we knew that going in.

24689157,457247117,2019-05-23,236415482,Jacqueline,"Warm, inviting, cozy townhome-just 3 miles south of HWY 70.  Easy to find! So close to downtown and in walking distance of Trader Joe's and Snooze too!"
3992779,142123534,2017-04-06,123254769,Eric,Primo location and Elizabeth is a great communicator. Enjoyed our stay
30011181,458190676,2019-05-25,121851204,Tiffany,Very stylish and trendy modern apartment in the Rino arts district and super close to the Denver central market. Rino neighborhood has tons of great restaurants. There is included underground parking spot which is great but we didn’t have an issue finding street parking. Check in is a little tricky finding the lockbox for the key as well as the building so make sure you read the check in process really carefully. Host did a good job explaining it with pictures as well. This apartment is probably best for people without young children but we were fine with our 3 month old since he doesn’t crawl yet. Apartment was very stylish and looked exactly like the pictures. Host was very nice and very responsive to messages
14962389,286194255,2018-07-05,180704999,Erik,My family had a great time in the loft.  It was a great home base for us!  Easy access to the interstate to get to everywhere we wanted to go!

17922871,146749018,2017-04-23,104511288,Ashanti,"Dustin's place was absolutely amazing and the view from the roof top was breathtaking . His place was walking distance from an awesome dispensary and a beautiful lake. Uber and Postmates have so many available options for food nearby, I suggest Snooze for breakfast! I don't think I paid more than $9 for any of my Ubers. It was also a very short ride to and from the airport. Dustin himself was more than hospitable providing beers, juice, bagels, coffee and toiletries. He was very relaxed and really allowed me to make the place my own while I was in town. He also had many great suggestions on food and fun! I would definitely stay here again!  
"
23092127,419383317,2019-03-03,148452863,Jesi,The location is great and the space is adorable and cozy. There were so many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment and the private entrance is great. We really loved staying here!
20832904,271902169,2018-06-02,58503387,Dylan,"For the price, Alma's place was exactly what we were looking for! 

Location:
Lyft/AirBnb rides were dirt cheap to all the great places you will want to explore in Denver (RiNo, LoDo, Highlands, etc.).  It was close to a rougher part of town. If you're expecting to be directly downtown though - plan on paying for it. 

Room:
The room had everything we needed for our stay! Coffee/Tea in the kitchen. Towels/Linens were provided and we had access to more if needed. 

Shared Space:
Since this is a shared space, we could sometimes here the next door neighbor. This is just one of the cons of a shared space AirBnb. 

Communication:
Alma was super quick to respond. The weather changed a bit while we were there and wanted the air turned down. She responded in about 5 mins letting us know the air would be turned down soon. I think we waited about 15 mins and heard the air kick on."
27583000,324745664,2018-09-17,189434036,Amanda,This house was amazing to stay at!! Beautiful location!! 5 min from a Walmart food and gas station. And hour and a half to any mountain which was perfect!!! They kept everything clean and tidy! They responded quickly to my questions and were very nice!! It’s a huge space with 2 bedrooms and a full bath plus another half bath! The kitchen area  was wonderful plenty of counter space seeing as we cooked in every night!! Safe neighborhood and would DEFINITELY recommend anyone staying here!
36848043,556881229,2019-10-30,208464361,Matt,"This place is great! Warm beds, a Keurig machine, Netflix, pots and pans to cook- I'd recommend it here.

I also love the location, it's about 5 blocks from the rail stop. It's also about a half mile from lots of food options, a perfect walk for a meal."
20441430,317173445,2018-09-01,39514064,Julia,Very clean and spacious place close to a beautiful park! Friendly host who is quick to respond - would recommend to anyone looking to explore Denver and feel like they’re at home!

36206107,540017025,2019-10-02,199826121,Hayley,Sparkling clean place. Everything was great besides the lack of tv channels (they have maybe 6 channels). There is an option for Apple TV but you have to have an account and log in. There is Netflix and Hulu as well.
20920175,569772152,2019-11-27,137400208,Allison,"Very clean, very comfortable.  Easy location to go to any part of town.   All basic amenities provided."

19909192,215772847,2017-12-01,3761123,Tyler,Jorge’s place is right in the middle of everything. You’re in walking distance to a lot of cool stuff like the arcade bar or the Fillmore. For the price you can’t beat it!

Her place is spotless and greatly appreciate that her place is smoke free.   I will definitely come back to stay with her next time I'm in the Denver area again. Thanks Molly.
19113386,296870788,2018-07-26,46584380,Chris,"Comfortable and well-appointed space, close walk to a number of excellent restaurant/nightlife options and a slightly longer walk/short drive/Uber to downtown.

31962384,499010899,2019-07-30,4901349,Lauren,"Bradley's place was in the perfect location for us, as we had an early flight at the airport and it took only 15 minutes to get there. There is also a great brewery just down the street and within walking distance. The only issue was that it was quite warm in Denver while we were there and Bradley's place does not have central AC. One of the rooms does have a window unit, but the rest of the house remained pretty warm. But this place would be great for any other (non-hot) time of year."
21630965,325084885,2018-09-18,46900559,Sabrine,"James was quick with communication - offered great local advice - had a very clean place.

The patio was a fun place to eat or just relax. There were plenty of clean linens and towels available. The house is also close to restaurants and fun shops, as well as a short drive to downtown. We would definitely stay here again!"

39405,47987281,2015-09-22,22659239,Krisztina,Cute little house. Chill location.  The owners were very friendly.
35734859,490466016,2019-07-18,86320102,Jessica,"Clean. Quiet. Towels, washcloths and shampoo/conditioner/soap provided. Description is spot on. Note that if you're visiting Denver to see all downtown has to offer, this is an easy 20/30 mins to downtown. The house is only a couple of miles from the airport and a bus takes you from the airport to a stop about a block away from the house. It was easy enough for us to walk from the bus stop, but you can always take a taxi/Uber/Lyft from the airport. I would stay here again."

We appreciated the clean simplicity of the space as we were tired from a conference and hiking and wanted a space to rest and clean up between outings. There was COFFEE in the cupboard. Thank you! The backyard was relaxing for an evening cocktail and smoke or morning coffee and we enjoyed every second we shared with Megan and Ozzie, we'll catch Ven next visit."
4263504,84145158,2016-07-05,176624,Madison,"Melissa and John were great to work with. Melissa reached out before our arrival, and helped us to arrange an early check-in, which was so appreciated! The house worked well for our group, and we especially loved being able to cook and grill out - thanks to our hosts for allowing us to use all of their equipment! There is also a small but very lovely outdoor space, which we also enjoyed almost every day of our visit. The location was about a 25 minute walk or 15 minute drive from most of our destinations within the city. We were glad to be able to uber easily to dinners, breweries, etc. We also rented a vehicle so that we could take a day trip to Boulder and another to a beautiful rocky mountain hike. Thanks again to our hosts. We had an amazing weekend vacation!"

13897351,95993587,2016-08-21,85383555,Jim,"Grace was a fantastic host.  Check in was a simple process, Grace would meet us or leave the keys.

The place had everything we needed for our quick weekend golf trip and Grace was always available if we needed something.

We had a day where one of the guests  wasn't with us but had the keys, but no worries Grace met us with no issue to get us in and provide a second key.

I will absolutely stay with Grace again on our next trip out to Denver! 

Thanks again for a great weekend Grace!!"

22748285,234681189,2018-02-13,171445573,Anita,"All I can say is WOW!!!!!! This place is beautiful, private, quiet, filled with nice amenities. The furnishings are classy as a 4 star hotel, comfortable, especially the master  bed, The bathroom has anything you may have forgotten to bring. kitchen has numerous snack and breakfast foods. The host owners are there for you if you need anything, while respecting your privacy. Loved my stay, Did I mention close to the airport, yet far enough away you don't hear the plane noises."
15534324,165708945,2017-07-01,127364489,Emily,"The Dailey Park House was exactly what we needed and very comfortable. The beds tended to be quite firm, but the amenities were perfect and we are very grateful for Kat's hospitality. The big dining table was great to sit around with friends and chat. Overall, would recommend this house!"
2978155,44883080,2015-08-30,28219289,Mark,"John was very welcoming and he was available via text to answer any questions. The neighborhood was perfect with Whole Foods, B-Cycle rental station and Sexy Pizza all within 2 blocks walking. 
The house was clean and tidy and we all slept great. I would recommend John any day of the week and the location was preferred as Uber rides to the light rail were under $7 and bike rides cheap and easy. Thanks again for everything!"

21013551,315799586,2018-08-29,132579710,Brent,"This is the first time I've used AirBnB and I was a little worried about spending two months in someone else's house, but I could not have felt more at home.  In fact, it became my home away from home.  Gregg and Katy are great hosts and have a relaxed, direct communication style which put me at ease, and they assumed I could figure basic things out without a lot of directions on their part.  They did give me awesome advice on where to hear good live music, the best places to eat and drink, and the best hikes to go on, which made my time in Denver really enjoyable. The room had more than I had hoped for.  I especially liked all the space in the walk-in closet and the drawer space in the bathroom.  The bedroom windows look out the front onto a quiet wooded boulevard, making it a nice place to relax, read or watch TV.  I loved the cool music-themed decoration and Gregg's paintings throughout the house, which give it a lot of personality and made a fellow music lover feel right at home.  It was also enjoyable to sit out on the back deck in the morning and evening, and I always felt at home downstairs when I was feeling sociable.  Their cats, Mojito and Stormy are very affectionate pets, and great company too.  All this made for a great experience and I hope to stay there again the next time I come to Denver."
7663335,46929171,2015-09-14,10932594,Mike,"Excellent condo and location. Super clean, large bathroom, comfy bed and couch, huge TV, fast Internet and nice neighbors. We will definitely be reserving this spot next time we are in Denver."

15902411,313645834,2018-08-25,198521125,Jessica,"We had such a great time in Denver and the stay at Jessica's was perfect! Short car ride to downtown, she provided things to eat for breakfast if needed, and the space was so nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed! It was also great that she provided some options for restaurants and activities near her place and around Denver for anyone not familiar with the area. Will definitely be staying here if I find myself in Denver again!"

937952,3871584,2013-03-23,2458225,Sandra,Amanda was very welcoming and respectful. The location is great and  the apartment is charming and comfortable. Amanda needed to stop by during our stay to grab some contact lenses and she was very respectful about our privacy. We got a letter on our car from one of her neighbors for using her parking spot while we were there and she was totally accessible by phone and text when we wanted to contact her about any of our concerns. Highly recommended!
4263714,553254471,2019-10-23,133374563,Taylor,Melissa and John were quick with communication and very helpful with anything I needed. The space was very stylish and clean! All in all great space for the price.

6333040,135180167,2017-03-03,7037380,Mike,"Mick was an exceptional host and is carriage house Airbnb was one of the most memorable Airbnbs I've ever had the opportunity to stay at. It was apparent how much love and thoughtfulness went into designing the carriage house. It was exceptionally well appointed with robes, great product, chocolates, and other amenities. It was an outstanding experience and we definitely plan on returning next time we're in Denver."

4744179,500202630,2019-08-01,46588245,​André,"Staying at Marta and Michael’s place is like staying at a second home – only it’s a much-improved version of that home. Comfortable, elegant in a very casual way, nice touches all around the house, easy access to utensils, tools, batteries and the like. 

Plus, communication was fast and easy. Marta and Michael are very responsive. Since they are organized, getting things done was extremely easy. 

Their house is larger than expected. There’s plenty of space to relax either on the front porch, in the formal living room, dining room, kitchen or back yard. Plus, there’s a fantastic garden in the front yard. 

I look forward to being able to stay here again. In addition, getting a bunch of work done, I had wonderful, relaxing time. Highly recommended!"

27425457,311230104,2018-08-20,35466611,Christie,"Willow's place was ideal for our team of cyclists, who were in town for the Colorado Classic mid-August. It was ideally located, well furnished, and spotlessly clean. There were several nice little touches, and the it was clear that Willow had gone out of her way to make us feel welcome and at home. We'd highly recommend her place! "
18567419,190597413,2017-09-04,17329119,Brian,"This is an amazing AirBnB, if you see it available: jump on it. The space is comfortable and beautiful, and super spacious for a large group.

13656664,112896716,2016-11-08,58520240,Destiny,"We had a quick stay with Shane. The basement apartment was adorable, comfortable and welcoming.

5070640,36144538,2015-06-25,3964193,Kristin,"I had such a nice stay at Andreas- she was out of town but was  still very communicative. The place was just perfect with a living room bathroom and kitchen on the bottom floor and an open loft bedroom on the top floor. The AC unit was nice to have and she had a lot of nice extras like a keurig and some fresh fruit too!
The neighborhood is perfect- bars, restaurants, the best beer/wine shop, a cheese shop and a handful of boutiques within 2 blocks. We plan to stay again when we return in the fall!"

23521683,360203128,2018-12-19,11573458,Elyssa,Chelsie was nice and responsive and this place is adorable. Photos are accurate. It’s clean and very cute! Just note that the reason it’s only $55 a night is because you’ll spend a lot constantly taking $10 Ubers and Lyfts to get everywhere. It’s in a boring residential neighborhood. But again that’s why it’s cheap so it’s fine. The place is priced how it should be. Super cute nice stay overall and would recommend
32958628,531107751,2019-09-16,12362269,Annie,"This is our second time staying at Rachel’s adorable spot.

Highly recommended!"

The unit was exactly as described and shown in the photos - fantastic.  It was a beautiful neighborhood close to restaurants and groceries and a few minutes by car to downtown Denver. The muffins, coffee, and juice were perfect for first morning. We would definitely return!"

13171401,207749591,2017-10-29,57738824,J. Christine,Safe and comfortable. Some noises because you are downstairs but I wear earplugs to sleep. I felt completely safe and unbothered
8718728,79200302,2016-06-11,22679101,Yuti,"Rachel's home is clean and cozy,we stayed there for one night. Rachel is very friendly and easy to communicate:)"
16089404,327413612,2018-09-23,150969979,Parker,"Excellent place. Great location. Jim the owner couldn’t be a better host. I would definitely stay here again when I come back. 
Rent a party bus if you go to Red Rocks. The party bus puts you steps from the gate, if you drive it’s a hike to get to the venue. RINO beer garden is a short walk- definitely rent a scooter too. Made exploring breweries and eateries fun."
8411050,96367442,2016-08-22,24371218,Colton,"Place was comfortable and stocked with most items you could easily need or forget. Host provided a key to lock our room in case we needed it, and the dog was super cute! I definitely recommend this place to other people!"
22209112,455398332,2019-05-19,2662553,Katie,"James is a fantastic host!! We actually booked a smaller Airbnb of his, but when something came up with that location he offered us this much bigger space at no extra charge. The house itself was super clean and the kitchen has any amenity you could possibly want. Extra towels and linens are available if needed. Our favorite perk was that James' space is dog friendly so we were able to bring our ""kids"" with us! Communication with James was always warm, quick, and easy, and he sent us recommendations of places to check out while were visiting. We can't recommend him and his home enough!"
90307,160564462,2017-06-14,28996470,Cheyenne,Such a wonderful place in Denver. Doreen was extremely welcoming along with her very cute dog. Definitely has a great space and would highly recommend if you're in the area. 
9445553,204568322,2017-10-18,150270994,Don,"I was hosted by Sarah for a bit over a month and I have to say I enjoyed my stay. Sarah is a great host who is super attentive and very nice. The value you get from staying with her is not matched in Denver for the price. The location is super convenient to downtown Denver. I recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable, clean, and friendly place to stay."

The house was clean and modern and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Denver. Thanks Zach!

Everyone had their own place to sleep and it was a nice 15 minute walk over to the Ritchie Center for the graduation. The space was beautiful and had everything we needed- and we had a blast playing ping pong! We wish we could have stayed more than one night as it was a very comfortable stay for our group. Thank you Chase for allowing us to enjoy your home for the night!

I would stay here again! The only downside is that it is a little ways away from things so be prepared to either walk a couple miles or uber. 
14538608,258839209,2018-04-29,37050920,Leslie,"Book this place if it's available!  The neighborhood was lovely, plenty of stuff within walking distance (even the 16th street mall was only a 45 minute walk or a few minute Uber ride), and street parking was readily available.  Sam's place was very spacious, comfortable, and had everything we needed (from mini shampoo bottles and a hair dryer, to directions for the remote).

The house is next to a lake with beautiful views and paths for running and biking. 

Brian knows the area well and made excellent suggestions for food, massage as well as simple things like the closest post office.  

The place feels homey and has everything one needs to cook and relax. We really enjoyed the swing on the front steps. "

If you want to connect with people who embody a true ""stay with your friends"" experience then stay with Jeff and Sweets. You'll completely forget you got to know them through Airbnb as they become your friends and not just your hosts."

The rooftop deck views of the mountains and Denver skyline were spectacular, and you couldn’t ask for a better location. The townhouse is just a few miles from all of the breweries and stadiums(average $5-$8 uber ride). We went to Rocky Mountain National Park, a Broncos game, Rockies game and concert at Red Rocks during our stay, and the condo was the perfect place to go “home” to. Can’t imagine staying anywhere else, and hope to visit again soon! Thanks Brody!"

The home has been beautifully restored, is clean and with fun personalized touches to make travelers of all ages and places feel welcomed from the pin world map in the entry to legos and games. Five close friends from college and myself visited for our 12 yr college reunion. We loved the space both indoor and outdoor which comfortably accommodated the 6 of us well to catch up and relax. Chalise and Ghassan were fantastic hosts with clear and prompt communication, were easy to reach and had wonderful recommendations for their neighborhood. We would love to be back!"

3349024,86508243,2016-07-16,77811660,Terry,"Dawnelle was very accommodating to our early arrival and had the basement very clean.  The complimentary coffee and was nice in the morning as were the energy bars.  The fridge was stocked with quality flat and sparkling water plus orange juice.  

Both queen size beds were nice and we liked the ability to dim the lights.  One bedroom we did put a blanket over the window to keep the morning light down.  Bathroom was nice and big.  Well stocked with towels and toiletries. 

Dawnelle checked on us a couple of times to make sure we were doing well.  Our 8 year old daughter loved the trampoline which was in great condition and had a safety net all around.   
Then playing with a visiting niece doubled the fun.  The backyard was nice.  In the afternoon it is in the shade making it very pleasant on hot days.  

Dawnelle has 2 very friendly dogs and she asked if it alright if they came out while we were out.  We said they can be out anytime we are out.  She would have kept them inside if we wanted.  The dogs were very quite and never heard them bark.  Only very occasional pattering of paws were heard.  

It was very quiet in the neighborhood that is in an area somewhat going under a revitalization. We felt safe parking on the street.  

The basement remained pretty cool and Dawnelle has air conditioning.

Being our first AirBNB experience this certainly exceeded our expectations in all facets.  "
19714594,438812308,2019-04-17,65595446,Daniel,"Tobi is a great host! Plus she has 3 very friendly and polite dogs for entertainment!

The only concerns I would say is if you're a taller guest, the bed is slightly short (its a double in the most conservative sense.  Otherwise, I hope to stay here again!"
17623101,166820070,2017-07-04,53819443,Anjali,We loved the neighborhood  - James's local recommendations are on point. We did have trouble utilizing the parking as the garage was not long and wide enough to fit an SUV and the listing did not state that information clearly. We loved the outdoor space and the home - would definitely stay here again in the future.

Perfect location right next to downtown Denver with tons of options for food. Also, right down the road from a couple of cool breweries. The bags set in the back yard was a nice touch and the back yard in general is great because of the privacy, Patton, grill and fire pit.

Definitely recommend staying there!"

15807058,262692435,2018-05-09,31234049,Laura,"This apartment was perfect for my business trip. Amanda space had lots of considerate touches like a white noise machine (although the apartment wasn’t loud) and common condiments. I travel solo a lot for work and often stay in urban neighborhoods with a bit of grit. Amanda’s place felt very safe and calm. It has a charming balcony that offers a little outdoor space. I hope to I can stay there again. My only caveat is that the apartment offers limited TV/movie options. However, the internet connection is strong so your personal devices can stream entertainment easily."
590,479343,2011-08-27,947719,Cindy,Jill is a wonderful host. Her home is very comfortable in a great area. First time user of airbnb and I feel Jill has set the bar high now for future uses.
6488535,332620266,2018-10-05,184284023,Gina,This apartment was our first Airbnb experience and it was truly great. The building is secure and on a fairly quiet street with friendly people who live there permanently. There are plenty of places to eat and check out a couple blocks over. If you’re visiting and going into downtown I definitely suggest taking the train! Super easy and cheap!

3562277,17773477,2014-08-17,6507096,John,"Michelle and her family are just great hosts, fun, interesting, kind, and respectful. The house is perfectly located, close to Denver and local shopping/restaurants, yet in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. The Japanese garden in the evening is about as tranquil a setting as you could find. I could go on for pages, but the short synopsis is, if you're going to Denver and don't want/need to stay downtown, you can't go wrong staying here!"

The unit is newly remolded and was cute inside. There is no central AC— the hosts provided a portable AC unit in the dining room, which was extremely loud and there is also a window AC unit in the bedroom (which was not shown in the photos). This was also very loud at night loud and blew cold air out directly on one side of the bed. 
I am highly sensitive to mold and though there wasn't a huge mold problem, I did notice it when we walked in. If you are sensitive to mold, check with the host first.  

We like spending time in outdoor spaces, but neither patio in this space was inviting."

Zack was very friendly and was quick to offer his assistance and phone number. He added nice little touches to make our stay feel authentic, like our own home. The home is new and clean. Zack and Bisquit (the house cat) were friendly yet they gave us our space to do our own thing. If you are renting a car it’s a great location as a mid-point between Garden of the Gods and other National Parks. We also came to find out that the house is walking distance from a bus which takes you to the city and airport for a $9 a day fee which I would consider utilizing on our next trip."

Quick to respond to inquiries, super clean house when we arrived, extremely detailed and insightful instructions/directions for the house and the surrounding neighborhood.  Highly recommend Bev’s house for any type of event - a weekend away, guys/girls weekend, whatever. Thanks so much Bev!!!"
27962395,323052823,2018-09-14,53434875,Zephyr,"Molly's place was a great affordable option in a luxury building. Very private as this room has its own half bath and is on the 3rd floor by itself. 5 minute walk to the light rail makes it super convenient, especially if you don't have a car. Molly was friendly and very communicative - it was very easy for me to get in even though I arrived pretty late in the evening. Great host!"
23395457,334339346,2018-10-08,11046712,Garrett,"We enjoyed the place. Great location and nicely kept. The check-in process was late, but other than that the place was very nice."

14538608,468096681,2019-06-11,27552816,Madelyn,"This was a great place to spend our time in Denver. Very spacious place for the two of us. I wish we could have spent more than one night! The living space was very accommodating and the kitchen comes stocked with plenty of essentials, including coffee and fruit!"
36867824,527394253,2019-09-10,185901311,Jessica,"Daydream provided the amenities and cleanliness of a luxurious hotel with the coziness of staying in someone’s home. The pool, lounge and fitness facilities were amazing - complete with chilled eucalyptus towels and complimentary coffee. The apartment was immaculate and charming. Ali, was attentive and full of great insider tips.  Highly recommend!"
15398641,161092821,2017-06-16,13635965,Kayla,"My sister and I really enjoyed our stay at Taylor and Scott's. Their home was beautiful and clean. The snacks and toiletries that were provided were much appreciated as well! 
I would definitely stay again if I make another trip to Denver. "

17210049,151587838,2017-05-13,31862730,Sam,Hasan and Allie were great. There place was awesome! You can't beat a rooftop with mountain views. I'd highly recommend this place!
10061459,484818667,2019-07-09,169717788,Samantha,"Emily's place was just as expected with a few extra touches! Very cozy space, very nice and clean bathroom, a few beers in the fridge and some extra bathroom amenities and coffee available. Easy to get anywhere from this location and had a place to park a car. Great stay!"
32085377,503282418,2019-08-05,73669863,MarcoAntonio,"Joel's place was at a great location, a few minutes drive to downtown and about 25 min from the airport. The place was sparkling clean and had everything that you need to feel comfortable. Will definitely recommend this place."
29622401,362626970,2018-12-26,40882235,Hannah,This is a wonderful location to see all of what Denver has to offer. Everything was within a 15 min drive. The place was beautifully furnished and the kitchen was stoked with every utensil we could ever need. Not to mention the amazing memory foam mattresses! I would definitely stay again if I came to Denver!
20914531,532865128,2019-09-20,44681052,Janis,"Our stay was safe and relatively quiet. The best part of this place is its location with easy access to downtown, the airport and many breweries in the area. The coffee-making option is a French press, so study up on how to do that if you have not done that before :). It was fine for a place to come back to when we were ready to turn in for the night, and we slept well."
19592823,305090970,2018-08-10,207162524,Joham,It’s an amazing unique place!! You feel that you rented a entire place for yourself. First floor it’s all for you. Thanks Julie

852934,475759255,2019-06-24,42870617,Jeanette,"It was a good place for us to stay because the number of beds and number of guests matched! We had the three women in one room with the three beds and two men with their own beds, one in a private room and the other small bed in the living room by the entrence.  She had notes throughout the house with simple instructions which were very helpful."
16177792,270117995,2018-05-28,163065595,Chris,"Great location, excellent communication, and a beautiful back yard."
7843605,100317168,2016-09-08,18292171,Elizabeth,Cynthia was very accommodating and the place was nice and spacious. I would definitely stay here again.
6488535,76560761,2016-05-28,32289063,Shelly,"Brandon's apartment and hospitality were superlative. Apartment was just as advertised, perfect for our short stay. Pre-arrival communication through departure, we got everything we needed and more. He really knows Denver and helped with Red Rocks, too!  We felt like he was a super host and blew us away. "
665622,346761928,2018-11-09,54213936,Blake,"Becky's place was awesome, great location and a fantastic place to stay!"
23905333,474960803,2019-06-23,188043020,Steffi,The place was very nice and close to downtown. There’s also a lot of restaurants and some boutiques of walking distance. The space itself is very stylish and relaxing. It can get loud at night since it’s near a semi busy street but that didn’t bother us at all. Rachel did provide some disposable earplugs which is was very thoughtful. She also had 2 local beers waiting for us in the mini fridge which was awesome. I highly recommend this place for anyone thinking about visiting Denver.
34570436,529356725,2019-09-14,91482018,Steve,This place was great. Tons of places in walking distance. Make sure to pack your walkong shoes.
21069884,360202943,2018-12-19,223729436,Oliver,Amazing place with great amenities. Seth had great communication during our stay and not only answered any questions we had but also offered great suggestions for food. Overall great experience would definitely come back.
32065545,492877665,2019-07-21,144199593,Jasmin,"Awesome place not too far from downtown Denver! Frederick and Kayce were great hosts, helped us with anything we needed. The place was MORE than expected, would stay again."

12365447,94108595,2016-08-14,59961920,Caitlin,"The Urban Farmhouse was the perfect set up for 2 couples. Identical rooms, shared bathroom (with lots of toiletries), and a great living room for watching the Olympics and planning meals. We were in Denver during a really hot spell, but the air conditioning was amazing. 

We loved the house and would recommend it to anyone going to Denver. "
18304991,517704644,2019-08-25,63674688,Lynn,Aaron and Mallori were great with communication before my arrival. The self check in was very handy as I did not arrive until late in the evening. I was only able to spend a little time there because I arrived late and had an early flight out but I look forward to going back when I can stay longer.
8556263,456899047,2019-05-22,59238787,Joanne,We stayed here for a short trip to Denver and it was exactly as pictured. It was very clean and had everything we needed. It was great to be able to make coffee in the mornings. Boon always responded quickly and even allowed us to check-in early.  The location was walkable to several breweries and several breakfast places (the wooden spoon and prosper oats).
18501879,530361327,2019-09-15,83529291,Alexandria,This place is fantastic! It's within walking distance to several great restaurants and is a short drive/Uber from downtown Denver. I highly recommend if you're looking for a clean and cozy spot with easy access to everything Denver has to offer.
21264389,452691798,2019-05-13,260062115,Keith,Incredible place to book.

18963379,197760509,2017-09-26,150754595,Alex,"Great property, professional attitude. Went the extra mile to bring coffee to our room - thanks guys!"
98008,3202768,2012-12-31,665995,William,It was great to stay at Jim and Lindsey's home again. Since this is the fourth time we have stayed at Emerson street its like our home away from home while we are in Denver.  Thanks so much and we'll be back!
5792083,463700231,2019-06-03,178697453,Joan,"My friend and I were in town for the Pop Culture Convention. This is located in a very convenient place as it’s a 15min walk away from the Convention Center. It’s also a short drive away from a supermarket, and the mall. 
It’s a nice private area. We had such a wonderful stay, the kitchen that came along with it was really the best part. We wanted to save some money and it was wonderful for us to be able to cook our own dinner. The kitchen is fairly well stocked. 
If you need anything the host is very quick to respond. We had a small hiccup at the beginning of our stay but Claytonius made sure we were comfortable and smoothed everything out for us. He is an awesome host. I really recommend this place. If I’m in town I would definitely want to stay here again."
34252983,544643195,2019-10-10,189931354,Andrea,Our host was very prompt with all of her communications. Everything went smoothly. We could not adjust the temperature in the guesthouse and we stayed there right when the snow storm was starting so it did get pretty cold at  night. There were extra blankets provided but could've used maybe a space heater. Other than that everything was great!
30283715,494689476,2019-07-24,76015279,Melanie,This place is cute but not fancy.  It is in a great neighborhood. For a basic place and great value this is it.
1622963,17970537,2014-08-19,19442124,Lauren,Tanya's place is beautiful! She is a very down to earth and sweet woman! We loved staying at her place although we did not see each other much because we were so busy. I highly recommend staying here! Very comfy bed and awesome upper deck. Thank you Tanya!! 
31805436,460184954,2019-05-28,6837394,Hannah,"The place is great if you're looking for a place to sleep near the RiNo area of Denver. Small space--just a room with a bed, and a bathroom down some stairs--but perfectly adequate as a place to crash. As other reviews say, there are thin walls and uneven stairs, but otherwise the place was fine!"
21662483,237375118,2018-02-22,4415192,Colleen,"A little slice of heaven - especially if you have a doggie!  Perfectly formed and decorated - the space is beautiful, clean, and bright.  The bed was incredibly comfortable. The yard is amazing for dogs - Beanz loved playing with the other two dogs on the property.  Hosts were friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again!"
12487223,107289137,2016-10-09,88802900,Will,"Great house, in a convenient part of Denver. We enjoyed walking around the lake, and to area shops/restaurants. Susan is a wonderful host, and I'd stay here again next time we're in town! "
25446225,327440243,2018-09-23,195075527,Chip,5 stars all around. Great condo and perfect location.
16548314,178518144,2017-08-05,47144449,Lauri,Near Botonical Gardens and the Denver Zoo. Short walk to Vine Street Pub. Close to Cheesman Park.
19812592,454645176,2019-05-18,233041246,Hayden,"Great home at a great price. She setup an easy check in and checkout process. She gave me good tips about Denver. Really clean home with two lovely dogs that love playing catch (just not in the house)
She has reliable internet and plenty of space to work in peace. She opened her home as if I were her family. 

She was very friendly and kind, greeting me very positively. The room is very spacious and clean. The bed is amazing and very comfortable. I didn’t have many questions but she was very vocal about being willing to help me out however I needed. I would very much recommend her. She deserves all the positive reviews she has."
477016,452700442,2019-05-13,257444994,Jasmine,"Tricia and David were the best when it came to making you feel comfortable and at home! Their home was warm and located in a fun neighborhood, walking distance to a lot of unique shops and restaurants!"
24658313,425236944,2019-03-17,79169344,Heather,"This home was so cute and cozy, absolutely perfect! The location was very close to downtown, too!! Willa was very fast and responsive with all communications and made my first ever stay with an Airbnb well beyond my expectations! If you have a chance to stay at this location i highly recommend it! The whole experience was hassle and worry free!"
13745963,137141992,2017-03-13,111554169,Rosemary,"Caleb's place is a fantastic home away from home. You will find it to be comfortable, clean and cozy. We spent more than a week here and it was a wonderful respite at the end of each busy day.  The location allows easy access to all parts of Denver and City Park is very close.  This sweet family are great hosts and we would gladly stay here again in the future. "
22362499,405838310,2019-01-27,70017944,Michele,"The place was cute, cozy and had plenty of comfortable sleeping space.  Zac was very responsive to messages and the check in and out process was smooth! 

The ad for the space said it was a family home and there may be some noise, but we weren't quite expecting the amount of noise into the very late hours of the night and early morning."
22139867,345972868,2018-11-06,158908620,Anthony,The place was nice as advertised in the pictures. My only issue really was the WiFi. Ran a speed test and it was below 2 mbps during my stay. Since the local channel and tv signal was really weak and couldn’t watch anything without it being choppy or laggy I was hoping the WiFi would be good to watch some Netflix or YouTube at night when we got back from hanging out but it was to slow so the stay was pretty dull unless you have plans out. And in the kitchen there’s a holder for paper towel roll but when we got there the roll was empty. Other than that the stay was ok.
25459427,530999531,2019-09-16,3562239,Ashleigh,"Rondi’s place is comfy and welcoming, with easy street parking."
21240412,339597475,2018-10-21,77148134,Patrick,"Great place, very clean and comfortable. Close to DU. Would definitely stay there again. Tricia is a wonderful host."
19983083,252686880,2018-04-11,6412417,Nicki,I was on a business trip to Denver but Teagan made my stay really great! The room was comfortable and personal with a separate bathroom. The bed is perfect for one but may be a tight squeeze for two. I didn't see Teagan or her dog until my last night but both were extremely friendly!
25982700,476180953,2019-06-25,258450653,Christina,"Very clean and convenient location. Parking was a little tight with a bigger vehicle but overall we were able to find parking every time it was needed. House was very well stocked with supplies and the host thought of most things one would need in a house. When we noted that the detergent was low in the house, Katrina promptly brought us more, which was nice. Cute house with good taste; a great welcome to Denver."
12365447,229629522,2018-01-24,17725017,Molly,Best place ever!!
2257217,44124509,2015-08-24,36121796,Danielle,I stayed with beth for a long weekend and it was an amazing experience. She was very professional and welcoming. She gave us suggestions on where to eat and what to do. She had two childen which were very sweet and well mannered. The location was perfect for our trip. Its close proximity allowed us to walk to most things. I enjoyed my stay!
11722154,69659436,2016-04-12,64372691,Scott,Enjoyed our stay. AJ was very friendly and helpful. Location is very close to downtown. Would use agian.

22399469,224250425,2018-01-02,58381104,Ethan,It was a very nice home
20292902,492949657,2019-07-21,67109072,Steve,Fantastic location. Fantastic host. 10/10 would stay again
14842171,336658107,2018-10-14,44110136,Paolo,Michele was an outstanding host.  she totally tried to accommodate our needs to the best of her ability. the space was pretty cool too. it was perfect for our short stay in Denver. I would definitely recommend this place for people looking to stay at a cozy little place close to Rino.
4817072,25795944,2015-01-26,23501535,Lila,"Matt and Mandy was extremely helpful and pleasant to communicate with! They were prompt to review and discuss the reservation process as well as answer any questions we had about the property and location. After our dialogue, we were very excited about our interaction and requested to book immediately! 

Mandy and I spoke prior to our arrival and getting to the property was very easy. It is located in the heart of Lo-Highlands which is absolutely amazing--the eaters, bars, shops are right outside your door or just a few short blocks away. We arrived at the house and easily accessed the key. The size of the house if perfect for four people and does not feel crowded at all. It was very clean and updated. it seemed that the bedrooms were newly furnished with fresh carpets. We also brought our two dogs--the backyard was spacious enough to accommodate them and the neighborhood is extremely pet friendly.

Without hesitation, we would love to vacation at this home again when we are in Denver!

31642586,532427083,2019-09-19,171712195,Ali,"Great location, within walking distance of downtown. Fun neighborhood, safe, and pleasant regardless of time of day. Parking (street) was convenient and accessible.
The space is stylish and stimulating in a pleasant, artsy type of way. Amenities are clean and well organized and hosts were very responsive. Book this place to enjoy Low High and Downtown Denver!"
19586542,357238383,2018-12-09,227319992,Constantine,"A very pleasant stay experience!  The property was sparkling clean and quiet surroundings made for a very pleasant stay.  My flight was over 2 hours late and my late check-in time extended past midnight, but Evelyn was extremely understanding and responsive throughout the process and a very gracious host!  Convenient Lowry location just minutes away from Cherry Creek, Glendale, and Downtown Denver.  Highly recommended!!"
21862479,354132755,2018-11-30,56767874,Rayna,"What an easy and wonderful home base for our two days in a Denver. We even rode bikes around the neighborhood last night. Easy check in, easy to find"
24284681,299370530,2018-07-30,70885702,Charlotte,Natalia’s home is beautiful and unique. She has a wonderful patio with a vegetable garden and her home is filled with quirky touches that make you feel at home. The location was perfect and nothing was more than a few minutes away. We looked forward to going back to the house and relaxing after a long day of exploring beautiful Colorado
6156061,96029049,2016-08-21,13754786,Julie,"Mark was very good at communicating the information to check-in, etc.  I have stayed in several AirBNBs and this listing was not at the same standard that I have experienced in the past.  For example, the kitchen didn't have enough dishes for everyone or all of the supplies we needed to cook. There was a lot of food in the fridge making it difficult to tell the difference between what we bought and what was not ours.  There was also an air mattress as advertised but not sufficient blankets or pillows to use the air mattress.  The house itself was very nice and accurately depicted in the pictures. "
32961930,515920999,2019-08-23,219681764,Jasmine,Beautiful place right above an amazing coffee shop and just a short walk from great food options. We spent most of our time just walking around the beautiful neighborhood and relaxing in the cozy home  So happy we got to stay here!
10927966,121746166,2016-12-18,41297239,Samantha,"We had such a great time at hostel fish! The rooms were very cute with their different themes, the bar is fun, the location is awesome, rooms were clean, beds were comfy, and the bathrooms were very nice and clean. We would definitely come back!"
17341684,483519149,2019-07-07,75733557,Linette,Great location and place was very clean. The pups were cute! Self check-in was a major plus since our flight landed late. Thanks Alex!
24520787,339493161,2018-10-21,873841,Christina,"Markus' place was great. Check in was easy breezy with a lockbox containing the key. Unbelievably comfortable (and firm, yay!) memory foam beds, a washer/dryer in-unit, tons of linens and towels, very clean, and super hot water. Walking distance from anything you might want to do in RiNo or Five Points, and they even let me keep my luggage in the unit post check-out so I could enjoy Denver before flying out later that evening. Great stay, would definitely stay here again."
23746299,502394079,2019-08-04,22807764,Peter,The house was perfect for our couples trip to Denver. The house was clean and had personality with the attention to detail and decor. The beds slept comfortably and we had everything we needed. Jim was on call to answer any questions for us and was very accommodating.
4344095,82500481,2016-06-27,5243841,Michelle,"Jared and Casey's place was perfect for our getaway weekend in Denver. It was located walking distance to breweries, Coors field, and the downtown area as well as the wedding venue. Jared met us at the door and welcomed us into his home. Very clean. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a private room in the downtown area. "
13901522,319938696,2018-09-07,179426790,Katy,Great stay at Danielle’s stylish and central home. Very close to wash park with great coffee shops around. Really comfortable bed!
6373869,421542918,2019-03-09,48590489,Kathy,"Ryan's house is conveniently located in Capitol Hill - lots of places in walking distance, including the bike share program. The room was comfortable, and as described. We felt like Ryan's hospitality was the best - very friendly, and knows a lot about the area. I recommend to anyone looking for a few nights in Denver to stay here!"
20996662,416984083,2019-02-25,119875386,Michael,Nice little space within walking distance to tons of stuff!
27455846,495933209,2019-07-26,4535125,Linda,"Location is great, and there were plenty of towels!

A couple bummers: 

The ac was out and although all the bedrooms had window units installed it did not keep the house cool enough and the bathroom was very stale and hot this is an issue I was told was being addressed so hopefully that’s fixed before other guests, we really didn’t spend much time at the house besides to sleep but sleeping hot is miserable.

Also the description said 6 beds but there was only 4 beds and one couch that seems very uncomfortable to sleep on so two of us had to double up!"
17044680,150705595,2017-05-08,113067789,Lauren,Annabelle + Christian made my first stay in Colorado comfortable and enjoyable! I highly recommend their City Park West abode. 
9770909,110399430,2016-10-26,2862406,Nicolle,"Very charming spot to stay.  It was clean and well kept. Only negs to speak of are that there is a school directly across the street and that the back patio area is not exactly private (windows from the adjacent unit face directly into it), however that is just a matter of personal taste.

Bev was so thoughtful throughout our whole experience- from the food and drink she had ready for us on arrival to her recommendations on places to go/things to do for a group of our size and nature.  She's great to communicate with, and we had an amazing time sharing the weekend at her house.  Can't wait to come back- book with Bev now!"

The check-in was very easy. This is easily one of the best AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed in."
7577128,40687863,2015-08-01,16679977,Uwe,"The house is nicely remodeled inside with new wooden flooring, new kitchen and appliances. The master bedroom is located upstairs and a second bedroom is attached downstairs to the living room. The bathrooms are new as well. Communication and checkin were easy. The house provides privacy and was very comfortable. As we arrived from Europe at the airport, we were happy our hosts provided some groceries. We slept well. The house is air-conditioned which is nice when it is over 90 F outside. Our hosts are very nice and friendly people, and we would stay there again."

7912052,140966873,2017-04-01,28292227,Chia Hui,"Aki San is very nice and friendly to me and my friend. We had no car until the 2nd day and Aki San took us to the rental car agency to pick up our car! What a nice host;)
We came back late at night but Aki San always had hot drinking water and snacks ready, and even left some coupons for us (becuz we mentioned ramen)! Very sweet!

The place itself is in the basement of the house, very isolated but spacious since it has its own dining and living room space. The only thing would be the air flow in the basement, but Aki San has the air purifier ready to use for both rooms. 

People traveling with big luggages will need some help to put the luggage to the basement, however Aki San is surely able to help. Main bathroom is on the 2nd floor, but there is an extra toilet near the laundry room for easier access. 

Thanks to Aki San (and Kumoちゃん)! We had a wonderful experience in Denver and Colorado:) "

We didn't have any issues finding or accessing the apartment, and Zac was quick to respond to our questions. The apartment was well-provisioned, and the space heaters helped us fend off the unseasonably cold weather. As some other reviewers have noted, there was a fair amount of sound transfer from upstairs, and while this doesn't bother us at all, it might affect light sleepers."

He made sure we had all information and etc. before our stay. He also had amenities you would expect at a nice hotel. The property itself was great—great location, new interior, private balcony off the street, fairly convenient access. The only warning I have is the extremely tight garage space.  But overall everything was great! "

She did a great job of giving us privacy yet being available to chat and make dinner/brewery recommendations. The apartment is beautifully decorated and is in the best location.

16159967,468923327,2019-06-13,110487316,Amy,We had a great day at the game with out of town family. Your place was a perfect fit for our little family. We even had some play time in the outdoor roof area with the kids.

17022504,305695634,2018-08-11,140034194,Kimberly,This was my first airbnb and it was great. Ryan's place was very clean and perfect for two people. You get access to the pool which is nice to have in the summer months. It was very relaxing and never too crowded. Location was perfect. It is minutes from downtown or you can walk to lots of places. There is free street parking and we never had an issue finding a spot.  Ryan's place is definitely worth staying at while in Denver. 
2267500,51138809,2015-10-18,356073,Christa,Grace and Cory were gracious hosts. Your cottage was in a great location within walking distance to shops and restaurants. At times I had to walk around myself due to my other half being in town on business and I felt very safe. The homes are cute and people are friendly. I was able to get into downtown within 15 minutes even on a zombie walk and marathon weekend. I would recommend this cottage!! Thank you again and sorry we didn't meet.
20198585,489387151,2019-07-16,273346594,Amir,"This is a really nice place. It was very clean and had everything you would need. Only thing not great about it would be the outside, clearly the inside has been well renovated but the outside could use a facelift."

15271643,202319075,2017-10-10,128241695,Saskia,Het appartement is niet anders te beschrijven als werkelijk prachtig. Uitzicht over de rockies vanuit de zitplaats bij het raam waar je sochtends een super zonsopgang kunt zien op de rockies. David weet overal de goede tentjes aan te wijzen en is heel relaxt als gastheer. Ook hebben we het plezier gehad zijn vader Gene te ontmoeten.
12761180,256462299,2018-04-22,159028396,Kaitlin,"First, Chris did a great job of communicating. From the moment we booked he was welcoming and after we left, he took the time to leave us a kind thank you message. We also got to meet him, very nice guy, willing to make the best of our trip and offer up suggestions for what to do.. and he also has a cool cat named Jack! Second the place was perfect. It has a balance of a retro style and upgrades (like the counter and bathroom :) that give it the feeling of comfort and modern luxury. It’s a basement that is a part of the house he lives in above. We could hear footsteps from time to time but we weren’t really bothered by that, it never disturbed our time. Additionally, we were given complete respect and privacy to enjoy and even miss the cozy place we stayed for 3 days. We will definitely stay again if we return to Denver. Lastly, we also enjoyed the location and the patio. We really enjoy being outside and were able to walk around to discover what Denver had to offer."
21869212,239422075,2018-03-01,5997152,Alan,Leon's place was amazing. It was a short walk to find good food and drink. It was also close to Union Station and convenient for taking the train from the Airport into Downtown. We would definitely stay here again.
33307276,551986472,2019-10-20,151153279,Stefanie,"Mary's place is great!  Super clean, tons of extra amenities.  She even contacted me ask what kind of snacks I liked!  She met me when I arrived, showed me the apartment, and told me everything I needed to know.  The location is great--walking distance to Pearl Street (cool restaurants and shops).  Also super close to Washington Park,  DU, Cherry Creek, and downtown.  The apartment is in the basement, but I barely heard a footstep from above.   No separate entrance, but you have the entire basement space to yourself.  It's a large comfy area with plenty of natural light through two large windows.  Mary and her husband are super sweet!"
39405,811407,2011-12-28,1532823,Lindsay,Jennifer and Giovanni were absolutely fantastic! The cottage is very cute and homey and the hosts were so wonderfully hospitable! I had a great time and really appreciate their flexibility and friendly nature!!

She was quick to respond. Her neighbor/the other half of the duplex was friendly as well. The area was quiet and we had no problems. The house was stocked with everything from toilet paper to laundry detergent. The space was clean and quite spacious. The beds  and couch are comfortable. This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and stay again.
23644967,290029137,2018-07-13,51738181,Jonathan,Matt’s place was just as described and very comfortable for myself and two guests. It was very clean and the communication was lightning fast. Thanks for letting us stay! 
28810743,418607241,2019-03-02,12757902,Audrey,"We stayed one night at Travis and Mitra's and had a great experience.  We were in town for Denver's first Friday gallery stroll and their house was within about 15 minutes of most of the places on Santa Fe and Rino that we wanted to visit.   The room was very clean and nice and the attached bathroom made it feel more private.  The shower was nice and good for a tall person and the shampoos and conditioners weren't just leftovers from some other guest, they were quality!  We got to visit a bit with them and enjoyed their easy-going and open minded conversation.   We'd definitely stay there again during a Denver visit."
18275427,191784210,2017-09-08,146444816,Ryan,Quiet neighborhood. It was a great cozy place to stay! Just walking distance from food and only a few miles from downtown! My girlfriend and I would definitely stay there again!

11123088,65663732,2016-03-16,18456417,Katie,Sean was the most gracious host!  Always available for questions or to lend me an item I forgot.  I believe I was the first to rent this space and it was exactly as it is in the pictures.  Everything brand new.  Most everything I needed in the kitchen and a short walk to the grocery or 7-11.  Caught up on plenty of tv marathons on the cozy couc.!  And the bed I slept on was heavenly!  Best rest I have gotten in a LONG time!  I was there for some R&R and I surely got it!  I will rent from Sean again - can't wait!!! 
20695085,518454881,2019-08-26,62017690,Courtney,"Megan’s place was the perfect location for my family. Walkable distance to many parks, pools, grocery store, and many restaurants. Should definitely check out Stanley food hall just a mile away! My six month old son was on the trip and Megan provided a pack and play for us.

Interesting location in a gentrifying section of Denver. I wished I had time to explore the neighborhood. Very convenient to downtown - 20 minute walk or 10 minute drive.  Would choose again if I am in Denver.

It was our first time to Denver, and the location is perfect: walking distance to union station, Coors Field, and awesome bars and restaurants. Also a really close drive to Mile High stadium. The space was extremely clean with tons of storage for your luggage and there is a really comfy king size bed. This is like a hotel, with other people staying and living in the building. Check in is super easy and the staff were really helpful and quick to respond. Highly recommend the Guild!"

I showed up early and did an early check in with no problems. While on my trip I didn't spend much time there, but it was definitely comfortable enough to hangout there if you wanted. They made the living room and kitchen available to if I needed it. It's close to public transit. When I stayed here I took the train every day into downtown. It's only 1 stop and the train goes all day. It was also convenient taking the train to and from the airport."
22552157,253193508,2018-04-13,148593366,Raymond,"The home is absolutely beautiful, very close to downtown, and the interstate. The beds were very comfy, the kitchen was well stocked, great water pressure, and hot shower. Excellent washer and dryer."
21947025,295589640,2018-07-23,173390983,Jilena,"This is the BEST place to stay.  Not only is it in a great location, it's clean and feels just like home...but more upscale.  The home itself is decorated very nicely and the sleeping accommodations are very comfortable!  The host is exceptionally detailed and provides amenities well beyond what we could have expected.  The welcome was heartwarming and thoughtful.  She was communicative and very responsive.  You will not regret a stay here...the rates are in YOUR favor given the excellent location and all the extra comforts.  A truly WONDERFUL experience.  We hope you choose to stay here as well, so you can see for yourself...but be warned...you'll be spoiled and have a hard time giving a positive review to anyone else!! "
19988833,293637301,2018-07-20,158570306,Cristina,"The home is beautiful, very clean,  and in a nice quiet neighborhood but still walking distance to lots of fun stuff. Morgan is very personable and helpful and made our entire stay seamless from start to finish."
10730155,189748128,2017-09-02,121161377,Helen,"Great place to stay, the house is very unique and very cool. Close to park and Zoo."
14932614,296383210,2018-07-25,64758861,Debi,Plenty of space...loved the outdoor patio. Short Lyft ride to downtown area 
16413329,223803049,2018-01-01,6192845,Clinton And Jackie,"Wonderful place! Super charming home in a fantastic location walking distance to great LoHi restaurants, bars and shops. The hosts are lovely and put a ton of effort into the decor and finishing touches. Soft towels and sheets and super comfy bed. Nice little fenced in yard for our dog to enjoy the outdoors."
24412319,272616241,2018-06-03,71188432,Daniel,"The place is in a great location. Accessible to everything. Not a very modern place overall. No speaker system and the tv is somewhat basic. We never received the WiFi password after I requested it. One of the counter stool had a broken back support. The A/C doesn’t circulate well to the 2nd floor, especially the room with the double beds. Overall it was good for what we needed and considering it was somewhat a last minute booking I can’t complain too much. For the cost I think i could’ve booked earlier and found a nicer place. "
16089404,322621167,2018-09-13,88490777,Mary Beth,"Great place to stay for an overnight or longer. We needed a space for 8 people during a training event. Jim's house gave everyone breathing room--with the high ceilings, larger bedrooms, big living room, and front porch to hang out on. Also, Jim was really easy to communicate with and he responds very quickly to questions and issues. We had a great stay and I would stay there again!"
17638704,196021850,2017-09-21,131688413,Lisa,Beautiful condo!! Great location close walking distance to restrauants and bars! Safe location!
28720471,538279769,2019-09-29,11693003,Sarah,"This is a fantastic place to stay if you want to check out Denver. There were three of us that stayed and it was the perfect size for us. It is within walking distance of some nice shops and a lake.  The neighborhood was safe, quiet, and quaint. Brittany was a great host, was quick to respond to any questions, and was both helpful and professional. I highly recommend this stay."
18396744,284528172,2018-07-01,54685380,David,"Tim's home was perfect for our group of 7. There were ample beds and bathrooms for all. The amenities like washer, dryer, updated kitchen appliances, and stunning master bedroom suite made for a very comfortable stay. We really appreciated that the driveway easily held our group's 3 cars though street parking seemed readily available as well. The location was close to both the A train station for getting people to and from the airport and to the light rail station that went downtown. There were several restaurants, breweries, etc. in walking distance."
4895802,67969799,2016-04-01,5670921,Emily,"Mahting and Erika were super helpful, responsive, and welcoming, from first contact and throughout our short stay. Their place is a lovely, well decorated apartment with nice views of Denver. It's very convenient to great restaurants, parks, and downtown! They had awesome recommendations for places to eat and things to do. "

17325994,491144129,2019-07-19,8331593,James,"Keith’s place provided a sanctuary of comfort. After a long day of hiking in 95 degree weather, I needed a place to relax and to seriously clean myself up. Thankfully Keith had just what I needed. The double shower head in the beautifully designed bathroom (and home) was luxurious. And after finally scrubbing clean, I was able to lay down in the most comfortable bed I’ve ever come across. It was awful having to leave the next morning. Please don’t miss this place."
27763772,523441776,2019-09-03,80708713,Eric,Vincent was a very accommodating host! Answers very quickly and leaves clear directions.
1959836,167672972,2017-07-07,84024038,Allison,"This was a lovely place to stay-I wish I could have stayed longer! The room was clean, cozy and very comfortable and the rest of the living areas were so nice and artsy. Beautiful and fun art on the walls! And the sunflowers! Gorgeous. "
4753876,416637587,2019-02-24,34764463,Breanna,"This was such a cute, modern, cozy place. Such a great location for exploring LoDo and downtown."
3412478,117343403,2016-12-06,1742584,Mandy,"Cute, clean and there are two very cute friendly cats.  It's a short Uber ride to fix and drinks."

26158183,323067313,2018-09-14,34819117,Kem,Amazing apartment with amazing views of downtown Denver!  Would definitely suggest!
37910517,556498927,2019-10-29,14557269,Matt,"This is a great location in terms of being able to walk to most things in Highland.  The studio is recently remodeled and done very well (in fact my wife has a  list of things for me to do when we get home!).  Space is generous for a studio, it has everything one or two people would need to be comfortable for a short or long stay.  The deck is awesome, unfortunately, it was snowy in our short stay here so we didn't get to use it.  We'd come back just for the deck if all the other things weren't great too, but they are."
6333040,115613427,2016-11-25,1838322,Roxanne,"Wow.  Mick, our host, pretty much ensured our stay was one of the best AirBnB experiences that we have had.  He came by the carriage house not long after we got settled in & introduced himself.  He gave some tips of city life and really provided a level of kindness that had been unexpected.    The amount of design that has been put into the carriage house is ridiculous.  The heated floors alone were a luxury.  The bed was so comfortable and the couch was cozy.  I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else in Denver...and at such a great price.  Mick even had snacks waiting for us when we got into the house...which were promptly ingested.  The house has an ample amount of housewares so cooking in a breeze.  Basically, you have everything you could need.   We slept with the windows open almost every night without worry.  We definitely intend to return when we can.  You would be doing yourself a disservice by NOT staying here."
6044888,358766113,2018-12-15,184282095,John,"Denise is a wonderful host, great private room downstairs and ideal location!!"
29275338,463167107,2019-06-02,14813245,Russell,Liz's place is a stylishly decorated historic apartment in a great location in Denver! It was the perfect place to crash for a few nights after busy days exploring the city.
36880394,527819670,2019-09-11,893567,Nikki & Danny,We had a great stay at the tree  house! Great location that was convenient to many things in the Denver area (it also was an easy drive to get to Boulder for a lovely day trip). Kitchen was well stocked for cooking meals at home and we really enjoyed the barbecue out back. Our group had a great time and would definitely return!
16163913,547172269,2019-10-14,231496082,Ashley,"Molly’s place was in a great neighborhood close to the park, and within a reasonable driving distance of downtown. The space was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I would stay at Molly’s place again the next time I come to Denver."
25257591,428687871,2019-03-25,173558579,Joe,100 times I’d stay here again. Wonderful stay for two.
3992779,98552424,2016-08-31,30560112,Dana,"From the time of the booking, Elizabeth was very communicative and responsive.  The place was clean and easy to find.  We arrived later in the evening and were starving.  There were plenty of places within a few blocks to eat.  "
17185409,195536368,2017-09-19,93679637,Michelle,"Definitely should not have 4-5 stars for cleanliness!  We were uncomfortable with the STRONG mold smell, stained carpet, tiles missing in the shower, splatters on the walls, filthy bathroom floor and grimey dust buildup.  It does have a great location with easy parking.  Laura was also prompt in replying and a nice host, but being charged $20 for cleaning in such a dirty place was frustrating.  We would not have been happy to stay a second night."
26281796,318887689,2018-09-04,19676228,Lindsey & Phillip,"this was a great place for us to crash after a concert at Red Rocks before our very early flight in the morning. We were only there for about 3 hours but got a great nap and really appreciated Monica and John's flexibility with our weird schedule!!!! will definitely stay again, hopefully for longer next time "
12227790,146364502,2017-04-22,93882489,Lindsay,"I stayed at Holley's place for a long weekend and it was wonderful! It's close to everything, easy to find, clean and comfortable. I'd stay again!"
18778248,313052412,2018-08-24,164321070,Alex,Best value for price and space.  Also a mile from all the stores on Hampden Ave. 
16548314,126407287,2017-01-11,20536952,Saige,"We enjoyed our stay at Thomas' house. He was very accommodating. We showed up early after driving all night, and he let us come and nap. The house was cozy and clean, the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. It was an hour and a half from our ski destination in Breckenridge and half an hour from hiking at the Red Rocks Amphitheater. The food he recommended in Denver was amazing and I would definitely stay at his place again."
23786376,508409819,2019-08-12,150990763,Nicholas,Great place to stay! Came with a few friends for a long weekend and had a blast.

David( who manages the place for his dad) was an amazing host and a perfect gentleman...kind, helpful and never intrusive to my space which was pretty much 3/4 of  the house....the location is perfect ! scenery better than any hotel, as you can see the majestic mountains of CO!  Luxury and Clean clean clean ...for me that is essential! I cant say enough for this place...oh yea ..Price is very affordable considering the location. Thank you David and Gene!!"
16589595,287846265,2018-07-08,188299802,Andrea,"The house is close by to the airport, easy to get to, nice residential area, peaceful. The room was very confortable and every detail was carefully looked at. Pets were really friendly."

23436094,298652106,2018-07-29,2484020,Andrew,"We had a wonderful time at Lindy's place. She was so fast and easy to communicate with and made us feel right at home while we were at her place. She had some energy bars ready for us when we got there, which was great for the hikes we took, and had a great list of restaurants and other things to try while we were there. Her house was so clean and had everything we needed while we were there. We'd definitely stay here again next time we're in Denver."
16870147,467674754,2019-06-10,29664712,Shereen,We enjoyed our stay here very much. The house is beautiful and Tanya has put thoughtful touches throughout.
23125376,339652565,2018-10-21,149642009,Michael,Centrally located near downtown Denver and nice quaint neighborhood
30367993,556879140,2019-10-30,31842835,Deborah,"We went to Denver for a meeting at the convention center. The location was terrific and the fact that Whole foods, great restaurants, Union Station, and the free 16th street shuttle were so close was terrific given the snow storm we had."
16313550,453438433,2019-05-15,5188965,Steven,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22414563,485394160,2019-07-10,26915404,Ashley,"Lack of AC is pretty bad in the summer. Description says, ""plenty of windows to enjoy the view"" actually means a view of the side of a house and a parking lot with homeless people sleeping in it.  Colfax, where this place is located, was really unsafe for me as a single female. I was harrassed the entire walk from Ogden Theater to the place...even wearing a hoody pulled over my head to hide. Yelled at by people driving by and homeless people morning and night. 17th street however was a nice getaway from Colfax.  Great bars and food. This would be an alright place if it was cheaper. The deadbolt didn't work so I couldn't lock the door, but host says he is getting that fixed."
26688184,401147686,2019-01-13,103743204,Emerald,Great place!! Very clean and tidy! Perfect location! I plan to stay there every time I visit !
36604444,495272073,2019-07-25,6849886,Marianne,"Ayo and Jim’s place is a treasure!  It is new and sparkling clean.  The location is perfect with a lovely neighborhood feel, and yet so close to grocery stores, shops and restaurants.  Jim and Ayo have mastered hospitality.  They said hello when I arrived and had snacks available in the Airbnb.  Before arriving I had asked if it was possible to use a hypoallergenic detergent on the sheets and towels because of allergies.  They went above and beyond and bought the brand of detergent I use and had the space all ready for me.  They even left the detergent in the unit incase I wanted to do laundry!  So kind! The hosts are so thoughtful and joyful and you can’t help but feel the same in their place.  They were very easy to communicate with as well and made sure I had everything I needed while there.  The bed was cozy with lots of pillows, the shower was amazing, and the air conditioning was a lifesaver in the summer Denver heat.  Parking was super easy and they provided a book of recommendations, which I found to be helpful.  The unit has everything for cooking which was convenient, and there was a cold water jug available in the fridge along with bottled water as well.  The space is so charming and I’d absolutely stay there again. Jim and Ayo, I wish you all the best!  Thank you!"
20358695,489883198,2019-07-17,28394348,Abby Laine,"Beautiful, comfortable and very well managed. Jen's place (and her co-host Zack) were beyond helpful and accommodating for our work trip in Denver. The location is fantastic and easily accessible, the amenities were thoughtful and the communication with the hosts was quick and accurate. The house is lovely and I wish we had more time to enjoy the front porch and back yard. Thank you Jen & Zack, we hope to be back on our next work trip."

Confortable bed, clean and nice design! We recommend this place for sure ;)"
7131495,152679457,2017-05-17,108223988,Noor,"Pretty much as he describes it, i personally didn't prefer it because i stay 5 days in denver and this was just not the most comfortable place for me, considering i had to take my baby's stroller and carseat up and down tight stairs. If you have alot of luggage, not the place for you. And also, he had a thing about keeping the heat on low, so i never said anything about it but i was freezing at night smh "
23877844,515958414,2019-08-23,23360945,Kay,Sarah’s place was a great place to crash in.  Very spacious with all amenities.  Super close to Cheesman park where you could take a jog.  Very accessible to downtown via Lyft/Uber.  Would recommend!

The check-in process was smooth and simple. The place itself is gorgeous and filled with so much great character. Easy walking distance to most everything we needed and an easy Lyft to the rest of the city. 

Would highly recommend!"

8797683,351716628,2018-11-23,52550106,Adam,"There were a few exceptional qualities of the place.

1) the toys and board games were great.
2) there was an amazing variety of kitchenware
3) the outdoor spaces were very good

The issues we had were:
1) there was an excessive amount of pet hair on all furniture. Especially the beds. While my wife and I have a dog we are both allergic to cats. We both struggled with our allergies throughout the whole visit.

2) we found used underwear in the master closet

3) we were not a huge fan of feeling like it was our responsibility to make the location ready for the next guest. (ie take out all trash, prep the exterior trash for the garbage pickup, wash and dry the sheets etc.)

4) we have always recommended providing disposable plates and cutlery for guests

5) there was an excessive amount of decor. For those with kids we had a very hard time keeping our kids away from all the breakable things."
28131765,544226914,2019-10-09,93136763,Angela,Second time staying here and did not disappoint. Place is exactly as described and you’re never too far from anything. Great hosts and very responsive. Would definitely return again!
23617474,488242875,2019-07-14,92655339,Summer,Perfect location! Super walkable neighborhood w tons of highly rated restaurants and bars. Several grocery options and pharmacy within a block. Apartment has a private balcony with nice seating. Comfy bed and pillows. Full size bath toiletries and hair dryer. Washer/dryer in apartment. Plenty of room for two couples. Couldn’t have asked for a better place for our weekend getaway.

4964614,87039142,2016-07-18,81359765,Linda,"Linda was an exemplary host and she made me feel welcome in her home. And everything about her home is lovely and clean. In particular, I enjoyed hanging out on the balcony, both at breakfast and in the evening. Overall, her listing is accurate, but doesn't quite do justice to her friendly dog. :) 

Her location is fantastic: everything on my must-see list (including the Denver Art Museum and the Denver Botanic Gardens) was within easy walking distance. The Capitol Hill neighborhood is convenient, with many great places to eat nearby.

Honestly, I have a hard time imaging a better trip to Denver, and staying at Linda's was a big part of that. Thank you!"

21189932,417869038,2019-02-28,4742290,Adam,"A favorite place to stay in Denver, it’s super stylish with easy street parking, keypad entry, a really cozy bed, many places to lounge about, and a host that is very responsive. More than responsive, Sam was really accommodating when a blizzard in Michigan delayed my arrival by a day. Rate generously adjusted and a 6-pack of local IPA to wash away the bitter feelings from the storm. Now *that* is hospitality. Highly recommended."

13724407,243957545,2018-03-17,161966125,Allan,"This small house was clean and comfortable and had everything we (4 adults) needed.  We especially enjoyed using the gas grill and the patio for a BBQ one evening.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe and only a few blocks from Sloan's Lake and the lovely park around it, which is great for jogging and walking.  Marco was extremely responsive to all our questions."

36639011,552856099,2019-10-22,96091932,Shawn,John’s place was amazing. The neighborhood and surrounding area was beautiful. Walking distance/short uber to the bars and restaurants in highlands.

7663335,494064317,2019-07-23,15652788,Christopher,"Great one-bedroom apartment in an up-and-coming part of town. Easy walk to good restaurants, the state capital, and the 16th Street walking mall.  The private parking space is in a convenient location - it made leaving the car and walking around the city no problem. The inside of the apartment is clean with a modern feel and updated appliances. Finally, John is an outstanding host - he is easy to communicate with, flexible, and kind."

14042383,163831465,2017-06-25,100830431,Clayton,Great location. Had a business conference at the Denver conference center. 10-15 minute walk or take the free bus that drops you off 3 blocks away. I was there for 7 nights and had something new to do each night in walking distance. High rise apartment overlooking downtown. Feel like I got a great deal compared to downtown hotels. Host was very friendly and helpful. 
18501266,185815245,2017-08-22,129564172,Katelyn,Friendly n outgoing he made you feel comfortable. He was very helpful and always answering questions we had and giving great recommendations of restaurants and places to visit. He was awesome!

The downstairs bedrooms seemed a little under instruction, but the rooms where also decorated beautifully. House is pretty darn close to downtown and some of the best restaurants in town. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the Denver area"
17175148,197182400,2017-09-24,72579806,Kelsey,I can't say enough about how great this place was!  We had 6 adults that slept comfortably.  It is a quick drive to the bars and restaurants on Larimer.  Kat was extremely responsive and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  I would most definitely recommend this place!
29414337,471593339,2019-06-17,20329631,Jeramy,Glen's place is a wonderful home in a fantastic part of Denver. We were able to walk to most things. Glen is very easy to communicate with and we would definitely recommend his place to anyone looking to stay in Denver!

26711487,431360798,2019-03-31,5213390,Jed,"Shelley’s Paradise is everything described and more! We stayed in her place with the intention of exploring Denver’s local shops and eateries for the weekend. My experience can only be best described in segments.

Inquiry: From the initial inquiry, Shelley was very informative and accommodating. 

Check-In: We received our access code days prior with detailed instructions as to where we may park and enter the home. 

Home: Shelley’s place is tastefully comfortable, accommodating, and incredibly clean. Thoughtful amenities from French press coffee to a full washer and dryer provided. I found myself admiring the home’s style top to bottom. Plenty of comfy sheets for two people, quality towels and toiletries, and a Roku TV fitted with Netflix and Hulu made it easy to skip the bars and lounge at home. Seriously, she thought of everything! 

Location: The home is a few blocks from all the happenings and eateries on S. Broadway! The neighborhood was friendly and lively. I enjoyed walking to the Corner Store a few streets over for snacks and breakfast. Uber and Lyft fates, when necessary, to RiNo and Downtown were no more than $10 (at this time). 

Overall: We’d be happy to stay at Shelley’s place next time in Denver; it was the perfect jumping off point to explore the city; then settling down after a long day. 

Thank you Shelley!"

8366762,212190098,2017-11-16,42048332,Max,"Came to Denver for a conference in the convention center, this place was an easy 20 minute walk there. Plenty of good food options nearby (sushi, vietnamese, pubs, chinese, tacos) and you're not far from the Denver zoo and botanical gardens. The place itself is great, much better than a hotel room with a full kitchen and washer/drier in-unit."

Crib, toys, books, puzzles, not too many breakables etc. Allison was very helpful and responsive and the house was just as pictured online. Beautiful backyard and awesome front porch swings were icing on the cake.  Thanks for a great stay!"

1959918,183601121,2017-08-17,60200908,Ankur,Mike's place was great for a few days to check out Denver. The place was very clean when I arrived. It is walkable to a few places and just a 10-15 min Uber to the main downtown area. I was there mid August and there was no problem with keeping the temperature down during the night with the cooling unit. A close parking spot made renting a car to take up to Rocky Mountain for a day hike pretty easy.
6017776,213336840,2017-11-20,153424898,Yoli,"Aside from a charming and cozy Airbnb, McKenna was a great host. Quick responses and checking in from time to time to see if we needed anything. If we are ever in the Denver area again, we would definitely stay at her Airbnb!!!"

Bed was comfortable with good support.  The hosts were very personable & flexible.  Location was super nice, on a quiet street close to 2 parks, several restaurants & Safeway with Starbucks inside.

7479013,51283924,2015-10-19,34520775,Margaret,"Briana put out fresh decorations of the season to welcome us (flowers and pumpkins of fall).  The house was very big, beautifully built, comfortable and perfectly clean.  Plus the neighborhood was quiet, friendly and  safe.  Briana was a wonderful hostess, giving us privacy but also available to ensure that we had a good stay.  We all expressed that we could easily have stayed much longer in this lovely home.  "
4180622,43281604,2015-08-18,39619410,Tiffany,"This was my first time using Airbnb and the experience could not have been better. A lot of thought has gone in to this guest space to make you feel at home on vacation. Probably the most relaxing vacation I've ever had because of the accommodations. The space had everything my friends and I needed. While we didn't cook anything it was so nice to have all of the amenities of home without the price of a full hotel suite. The location is great and was pretty much 20-30 minutes from anywhere we wanted to go with easy access to the interstate. Very private, quiet, and safe which was great as well. The pictures and description were more than accurate. Maureen & Carlos have done an awesome job with this space! Thanks for the best place to stay in Denver!"
22770241,322615433,2018-09-13,77115374,Leah,"I had a great time at Chris' place. His home was spotless and he provided me with everything I needed for my stay. If you're half as particular as I am about cleanliness you'll be happy. The location was ideal. I was a quick stroll away from any of my dining and entertaining needs. 
This is a great place for relaxing, working or exploring the area. I would highly recommend booking this location."
23858844,303163437,2018-08-06,51897589,Jason,This is a great place for anyone coming into Denver ! Lots of things within walking distance and also not too far from downtown! House had great a/c for those hot summer days! Met Nadim the first day and was super responsive but also gave us or  privacy. All in all it is a home away from home and would love to stay again my next trip!

33365990,523868416,2019-09-04,172098929,Zoe,"The living area is pretty clean and hosts are responsive to messages. However, entrance is a little difficult to get to as is it off to the side and slightly blocked by trees and bushes. The location is a little rougher but seemingly safe enough. Bathroom is new and clean and the bed is comfortable to come home to after a long day."
548897,47989779,2015-09-22,5899942,Jason,"We loved this quite, serene, oasis in the middle of the city.  Easy access to all the things we came to Denver to do.  The room was small and cozy, but not too small.  Great stay!"

5319847,28091735,2015-03-17,12242415,Taryn,"Megan was very helpful and welcoming! She provided us a list of places to go near by and rules for her house. The neighborhood is off of a popular street and parking is a bit challenging, but the location is very close to downtown. The description of Megan's place was accurate apart from the description of the bed. It states ""real bed"", but it is actually a piece of plywood on cinder blocks with a pretty thin foam pad. Not the most comfortable sleeping situation, but manageable. Overall Megan has a nice, quaint space that is reasonable for the price. Would recommend to others!"

14371267,187844053,2017-08-27,112967095,Lyn,"Lyft to downtown Denver is  $15-20 each way, $40 each way. Very clean and quiet, great communication from Shelley. Fairly priced. Our only issues with the stay were problems with the AC, some plumbing issues (toilet that ran, standing water in shower up to ankles), and lack of much information about nearby hot-spots, to avoid the 25 minute Lyft into downtown so often. There is no cable, but ample dvds are provided in the cabinets on the side of the entertainment center. We didn't discover these until the last 20 minutes of our stay, they were in the only cabinets that did not have labels stating what was inside. But that's such a small thing, it didn't bother us."
26607884,544241060,2019-10-09,41676105,Jen,"An adorable and stylishly decorated tiny house, it was just the right size to not feel cramped but also gave a sense of coziness. There was filtered water and drinks available in the fridge, lots of beautiful decor and plants, and the place was spotless. Eric was also kind enough to help fill up our faulty tire so that we could safely drive back to the airport to get it exchanged. It was in a great location and was the perfect place to tuck in after being out and exploring all day."

12454119,154003584,2017-05-22,15815196,Candace And Mark,Great stay close to everything. Neighborhood was super quiet and eating establishments were great. Loved having a washer and dryer in the unit as well as small touches that were thought of such as the night light that comes on faintly at night as one gets out of bed to use the restroom. Not bright enough to walk anyone but light enough so you know where you are going.  Unit was tastefully decorated and cozy.  David was very responsive and accommodating.  So much to do nearby. Would love to stay here again.

13041992,427006599,2019-03-22,245770566,Paul,"Dont be put off from the neighborhood or the exterior of the home. The inside is quiet, bed is comfortable, shower is hot! Nice little extras, water, soda, coffee, chips etc... That came in handy as I didnt have time to make it to the store. I had a day long job interview. I didnt stay long, so I didnt meet Jack, but from everything I experienced, he has a great product and knows how to maximizes a great experience for a reasonable price. Great value!"
3479122,92888465,2016-08-10,11021704,William,"This place was great. The manual gave us everything we needed to find the place, get in, and get situated. 

It's located close to nearly everything there is to do in downtown Denver, including Coors Field and 16th Street. 

The gated parking is fantastic as well!

We would definitely stay here again. "

It is literally across the street from beautiful City Park, which is the home to the Denver Zoo and Museum of Natural History, and also a great place to go for a run or watch the sunset. Two blocks the other way is Colfax Street, a very hip area with great food and drinks, all within walking distance on a safe and gorgeous street. Check in was easy, and we had no issues during our stay. Lovely place!"
9250245,227410558,2018-01-14,39197635,Paul,Rob's place was perfect for what we were looking for in Denver. It's a cool loft style apartment very close to some really good breweries in Five Points and a quick ride away from Downtown.
18509437,278729009,2018-06-18,183216189,Chris,We stayed here for Denver pride and the condo was absolutely perfect for what we wanted and needed. The location is awesome. We walked almost everywhere that we needed to go. The place was clean and comfortable. I think it made our trip even better.
13025480,75836390,2016-05-23,5742852,Christopher,"4 old college roommates (including myself) chose Kyle's home as a home base while we explored the Denver and surrounding areas.  It was a great experience - immediately upon entering the home you felt welcome, as they left (and emailed) detailed instructions about using the home as your own, even going so far as to leave out a few snacks and folded towels for us.  

The house is older and charming - wood floors throughout, some curved edges at the walls, and great moulding.  The kitchen is a great area - the big butcherblock center table was a good place for us all to gather in the morning and have coffee before we started our day.

The location and neighborhood couldn't have been better for our purposes.  It's a short walk to a nearby park, and we found great restaurants and breweries within a 10-15 minute walk on Vine St. and Colifax Ave.  (Our favorites included Vine Street Pub & Brewery, Denver Biscuit Co., and Onefold.)  It's also a short Uber ride to get over to other parts of the city, such as the Art Museum and the Downtown / Union Station / Highland areas (Linger was our favorite place over there).

Before our arrival and throughout our stay Kyle was always quick to respond to questions and make sure that we were enjoying ourselves.  It made the arrival, stay, and departure effortless and rounded out our great experience."

The kitchen was functional and had at least one of everything you'd need (pots, skillets, cutting boards, knives, etc.) if you wanted to cook there - and we did.  Beds were comfy.  The whole place was cozy and comfortable and well-designed.  We also enjoyed having the outdoor space in the back/side yard and the front porch.  I would definitely stay there again!"

The apartment is in a great central location with plenty of street parking right in front of the house. Mike provided a binder with lots of helpful info about his place and the area as well as a bunch of brochures for fun thing to do in the area. The apartment was great, it was very clean and had plenty of space for the 4 of us to spread out. The rooms were good size and had very comfy beds. Nice upgraded bathroom with a good shower and lots of clean towels. Kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessities. We also got to meet their dog, Shy, she was so sweet. Would definitely stay here again and recommend Mike’s place to anyone visiting Denver.

The bathroom is spacious and updated. There are 2 beds with enough space for 3 people. There was even a little basket of granola bars and coffee! It was the perfect little place to explore the Denver area or stay the night on your way somewhere else. Christopher was extra accommodating! We didn't need to meet up with him beforehand, but we ran into him when we arrived. He was very friendly and let us have our space. There is also a friendly cat that greeted us outside.

28581318,535584636,2019-09-24,64558823,Scott,"The loft is as advertised. There is a Ring video camera on the door, so you'll need to cover that with your hand while you enter the code if you don't want to be on video. A few minor downsides: The area is packed with homeless people (it's like a zombie apocalypse), there is a massive construction project next door, and the bathroom area does not have a surface big enough to fit a shaver bag. But overall it's great."

Amazing location—just a few minutes walk from tons of great breweries/restaurants. The downstairs was cool (loved checking out their art/plants), the bedroom as expected, and we never had an issue getting into the bathroom even though it is shared (the shower was slightly complicated, but no problem after I noticed the instructions—so look for those!). Check-in was a breeze and there was always parking out front."

From the heart-shaped brownies on arrival to all her helpful advice and even giving my dog a bath with me (!), she went out of her way to be helpful at every opportunity. The rooms were clean, large, and thoughtfully well-equipped. 

There's a fabulous enclosed dog park a short walk away, as well as another lovely park very close to the home. The grounds and neighborhood are quiet and very safe for walking the beautiful streets. Parking is easy and very convenient. GREAT place for peace or for a short walk, or drive, to exciting and varied restaurants.

I could have stayed here comfortably for an extended time but, alas, was scheduled to move on. But I happily recommend staying in her accommodations!"

We arrived before check in and Michele was great about letting us check in early. The home was everything you see in the pictures and then some. We all had our own space. It was snowing and our host was gracious enough to shovel snow for us so we didn't have to. They offered tips on local restaurants. We were 7 minutes from downtown and near a grocery store. We grilled (yes in the snow) and we played family games that were provided by Michele and Chaz. We loved our stay and look forward to visiting again soon.

Amenities were great, everything we needed.  

Thanks Joy for the fast responses to our questions.  We will stay here again next time we are in Denver."
9652984,113411661,2016-11-12,41283673,Rob,We really enjoyed our time in Denver.  Mimi & John's studio is right in the middle of Capitol Hill - allowing for easy walks to just about anything we wanted to do/see.  The studio itself is well contained and safe.  We especially liked the coffee that Mimi left us - yum!  We're in the process of relocating to Denver and will stay again if we need to prior to our move!

Lots of natural lighting in the apartment and a great assortment of books to read if you just want to stay in. Beds and bedding were so soft and great to rest in post hiking days. Nice assortment of shampoos and conditioners to use. 

Overall I would highly recommend Chris's place to stay in. Fast communication from Chris and all his directions are very clear. The welcome book he provides answers most FAQs."

The house itself was perfect for our family! The king sized beds were very comfy, we enjoyed cooking meals in the kitchen, and got to check in on the Olympics on the large flat screen tv while relaxing in the evenings. While we didn't get to enjoy the outside spaces because of snow, we were very impressed by the multiple patios and grill options, and hope we can stay here again if we get to visit Denver during warmer months!"

I did not spend much time at the apartment due to intense work schedule, but I always looked forward to come back there in the evening.  Fully equipped kitchen, strong shower, and a nice new bed were exactly what I needed at the end of the day! Josh was kind enough to provide coffee (special thank you for that), set of plates, glasses, cups- everything you need to (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Josh was perfect- he was efficient and fast in emailing back to me.  Check-in and check-out times were very flexible- another added value to the place! Can't say enough about this fantastic place- will try to come back with my family and recommend the apartment to all the friends.  "

The place is as pictured.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the back patio & yard is an opportunity to make this a really amazing space.

Also - while this unit sleeps 5 - note that it’s 2 double beds & a couch that doesn’t convert to a bed - so plan accordingly."
33896007,479275247,2019-06-30,16579522,Kimberli,"This is  beautifully updated and super comfortable space. Easy to find, centrally located; Matt was fantastic at quick replys and keeping us in the loop with any helpful information."

The house was amazing the beds could use a upgrade. The area is awesome. My asst. Made friends with the neighborhood restaurant owner I think he got a pizza at 4 am one day across the street. Downtown was within a few  minutes drive. I wish we could have stayed longer. Matt and Mandy were great host it was like their home was ours for a couple of days.

She was attentive to us during our entire stay and she went out of her way to make sure we were having a great time in Denver. Her home is exquisite- clean, peaceful, and the perfect place to stay in a neighborhood with easy access to the city! We spent several days in the Rocky Mountain National Park hiking, and it was less than a two hour drive away from Paige's. It was wonderful having a nice home to return to in the evenings."

They were quick to respond to questions before we booked and very responsive while we were staying there.  The house was super clean and had everything that we needed for a week long stay with our kids.  Very convenient to major roads and highways, but a quiet enough neighborhood to go for a run in the morning or walk the kids down to the park to play in the afternoon.  This was a great find and we would definitely stay there again if ever back in the Denver area.  (PS - As mentioned in a previous comment, make sure that you ignore the lockbox on the front storm door/gate and use the entry code on the deadbolt on the front door.)"

Located just a short drive from downtown Denver, the loft was tucked away in a cute backyard with a patio and path leading up to the door. Inside looked straight out of a magazine, and there was an entire binder of any info you could possibly need on your trip. My favorite touch was the complimentary bottle of Spanish red waiting for us when we arrived."

Great amount of space for a group of girls, really wonderfully decorated, and Kinga was so helpful with anything I needed. Can't recommend enough.  One thing to be aware of- this apartment is right above some noisy bars on a pretty loud corner of Colfax. We didn't mind at all since we were up most of the evening, but know that you will hear the partying until 2pm on the weekends."

There are two doors that both open with codes and it makes for a smooth check in  and check out. The place has all the amenities you need if you are traveling for work and a very nice work station.  I needed to get to the city center and it was a very easy 5 minute drive in the mornings. 

They had a bike for guests to use that I was sad I didn't get a chance to try out :)"

There is a guest refrigerator, small snacks, water, a mini coffee pot, toiletries, and more!  It was so quiet, I felt like I had the place to myself all week!  The house is located in a decent neighborhood, and I felt safe throughout my stay.  Restaurants and shopping were not too far away, and I had an easy time getting back and forth to my seminar each day.  Highly recommended - all my associates paying $100+/night for a hotel room were quite jealous!  "

4909321,206968313,2017-10-27,4320551,Kristine,"A truly wonderful home and family as a place to stay in a quiet residential Denver neighborhood.  The generous, warm hospitality of the host, Rebecca, here far exceeds any airbnb standard or expectation - a VERY wonderful place to stay, small-ish (fine) bedroom and shared bath with excellent walk-in shower and including use (coordinated) of washer and dryer. But the wonderful hospitality is the VERY BEST!"

21623221,245765952,2018-03-23,176471336,Caity,This Home was an amazing stay for my group of 8! We all fit comfortably in the house and felt like there was enough space. Host was amazing and fast to respond!  The drive to Loveland ski area was less than an hour which made this a wonderful place for us to stay. Driving anywhere in Denver took less than 20 minutes so we did our fair share of exploring. Kitchen came stocked with what you needed to cook meals as we chose to do most nights. Beds were very comfortable. Only downside is one bathroom but we managed and never ran out of hot water!  Overall house was great would stay again!

18963379,234426366,2018-02-12,25604639,Jared,Awesome place. The view from the apartment over the city is absolutely breathtaking and the master bed room had glass doors too so you could still see it from the room. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone coming to stay in Denver.

Super 420 friendly (although brace yourself for a cold smoke outside in the winter). The kitchen is fantastic (although we didn't utilize it as much as we would have due to the amazing places to eat in the area. Bring comfy slippers!
1189999,459645228,2019-05-27,71904536,Paolo,It’s a great place to stay at. Extremely clean and comfortable. They have a friendly dog named Shy as well. Will definitely recommend for future travelers!

Her place was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Kelsey was easy to communicate with and was helpful with all our needs.  We enjoyed the back outdoor patio to enjoy a homemade breakfast and do some work we brought with us.  Also, her home was minutes from downtown Denver.   We are thankful we found this place to make our time in Denver special!"

590,74080124,2016-05-13,35232856,Jae,"This was a very last-minute booking and I was so happy that Jill was able to take me.  The property is in a cool area, more central than I thought, with a large park the center of the street for blocks and blocks. I love that look.  Easy to find and get in and out of, Jill greeted me outside and helped with my bag.  I felt like I was visiting my sister, complete with comforts of home and a little bit of homey clutter in kitchen and bath.  The bedroom could not have been set up more thoughtfully, clearly she's learned a lot in her many years.  Lamps, table, outlet, tissue, trash can on each side of the bed.  Wifi info and guest book easy to access.  TV and videos, you name it!  The bed was very comfy, the room cute with windows on 3 sides.  The shower was fantastic. Plenty of towels, clearly laid out.  Jill had hot water ready for tea for me at night, coffee ready in the morning.  I don't eat early, but she had lots of nice breakfast food offerings if I'd wanted to.   Very very hospitable!  And she let me help her with garden advice too!  Thanks Jill!!"
24038986,303134176,2018-08-06,27330599,Tim,"We had a great stay at Rebekah’s place! It was as advertised, easy to find and within an easy/safe walk to South Broadway where there are lots of eating and drinking options.  Well located for getting to other areas (loved RiNo & Washington Park) and also to get on to the interstate for exploring other areas outside of Denver. "

Her home had all the right touches that made us feel very comfortable. Plenty of space for our family of four and we enjoyed her artistic touch to the place. All the amenities that we needed were there. The AirBnb section of the home allowed plenty of privacy. Joey the dog was so polite and sweet. Location was perfect for the touring that we had planned. Great experience, great home, and even better host."
24644409,350175938,2018-11-18,9879040,Malia,"Cruz is a great host. Friendly and quick to respond. He’s flexible and easy going, great traits in a host. 

The space is spacious and clean. Shared areas are stylish. Bathroom is very nice and close to the room. 

Location is about 15 minutes from RiNo not a lot in walking distance but a cheap Uber ride to where you want to be. 

Would def recommend. Great value."

2257217,321588353,2018-09-10,122943193,Michael,"This place was perfect for what I needed! I was staying one night in Denver by myself and just wanted a place to crash that was close to fun things in Denver. It’s near a bunch of breweries and cool bars that are walkable, or a really inexpensive Lyft or Uber. Check-in was a breeze and Beth was really accommodating and easy to work with."

The hosts stayed to themselves, so if you prefer no interaction (like me) this is a good option. Beyond that, the Native is in a great location at a fair price."
23905333,519510816,2019-08-28,235064636,Royce,"Rachel & Erik’s place is great! It’s Central to Denver & everything from food, drinks, coffee shops to breweries are all outside your door! Definitely recommend"
2257217,79477028,2016-06-13,44467694,Andreea,We spent 1 night in Denver in between trips and it was simply lovely. We loved the space we had and the hearty welcome (and the friendly black cat). The location was close to downtown and other places we were interested in visiting. Beth was an excellent host and made us feel at home from the beginning. We thank her kindly for the hospitality and recommend her place to everyone planning to visit Denver.

866145,81294370,2016-06-22,70040561,David,"I had a fantastic stay at Preston’s Airbnb! The hosts, house, and location are all top notch. Preston and Jan were very friendly and hospitable, and went the extra mile to make sure I had an awesome week in Denver. The house was charming with hardwood floors and extremely clean, and the bed was very very comfy. The neighborhood was also great, it felt quite safe and was close to Broadway which had lots of interesting restaurants, shops, bars, and breweries. I was in Denver for a convention Downtown, but I much preferred staying here (which at ~1.5 miles out was an easy Bus/Uber/Lyft ride or a leisurely walk) than Downtown--it was the perfect place to come back to. I definitely recommend this Airbnb!"
28585411,547260588,2019-10-14,92480216,Leslie,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Great location on a quiet street close to the Highlands area of Denver. Check in was super easy with excellent instructions. Host was responsive to any requests. They even swept leaves that had fallen overnight from sidewalk and stepping stones to make them easier to see. Cozy, clean room and bathroom. Comfortable bed. Nice extra touches like a Keurig for coffee/tea, microwave, book with info on local attractions and extra toiletries in bathroom. Slept great. Did use both fan and sound machine that were provided.  Note to any  ""older"" travelers, that basement is accessed via stepping stones from front sidewalk to door at side of house and then down a flight of stairs."

The accommodations were exactly as described in the listing, if not better.  Peter thought of everything you could need for your stay, down to the bathroom being fully stocked with deluxe toiletries.

An awesome experience and reasonably priced!!

Thank you again, Pete!"
1622963,67911171,2016-04-01,13498737,Amber,"I had the most perfect stay in The Highlands. Exactly what I was hoping for. Tanya's house is charming, cozy and has really good vibes. It's a treat to live in thoughtfully and tastefully decorated home. I took advantage of the large soaking tub in the guests private bath, the sun filled patio on warm-winter days and also the meditation room.  The house is bright with day light.

Tanya and I became quick girlfriends :)It was a lovely stay with girl chats over cups of tea. She's an excellent host, endearing and helpful. I hope and plan to stay again soon - it was a home away from home."

3115132,492908419,2019-07-21,270050202,Angel,Kate's condo is a very homey space with lots of great decour. Even with no A/C the condo stays cool just with fans.

My friend and I had a really great experience, and were very intrigued by the apartment's unique decor! As some others have mentioned, the area can be a bit noisy at night, but being a New York, this did not bother me in the least bit.  Definitely a great location and a clean, safe and comfortable to stay while in Denver. "

We arrived very late, but it was not an issue and check-in was very easy. His place is very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It has a jacuzzi and washer and dryer that I was hoping to use, but we didn't get to since we had a short stay. There are plenty of towels, extra sheets, coffee, a mini fridge, microwave, toaster and toaster oven. Downtown and everything else you might need including the bus is very close by. Overall, I would highly recommend his place. "

Julie’s place was comfortable, spacious and was in a great location for walking to places or taking an Uber. Coming from a land of stucco subdivisions, it was a real treat staying in a home with so much history. A guidebook in the kitchen had a bunch of recommendations and Julie was easily accessible with more suggestions and any help we needed, via in text and in person. Meeting the pup was a highlight! I would definitely recommended this place to others."

"
17251698,282948574,2018-06-28,6160842,Jessica,"We could not have imagined better hosts than Michael and Connie.  We were looking for a place to safely recover after Sally got eye surgery at Porter Hospital.  Michael helped us get in early, carried luggage to ensure that Sally could walk hands free, gave us great local tips and advice, offered us ice for her eye etc. and kindly left us some fruit for breakfast.  The place was comfortable, even in the 100 degree Denver heat.  The shower was excellent and the extra amenities thoughtful additions to create a great experience.  We would gratefully stay again."
33365990,522088098,2019-09-01,287250303,Karley,"This stay was extremely uncomfortable, from the post I was under the impression the owners wouldn’t be home however they were home.. it was in their basement.. bars on the Windows very creepy.. never met the owners.. we also are very respectful and I know one of their request was no parties and no loud noises from 10pm-7am However.... my friend and I got home at about 10:15 our first night there and were laughing and at 10:30 the owners messaged us to keep the noise down .. we are on vacation... laughing? We felt like we couldn’t speak because they could hear everything because we could hear them COUGH! No joke.. very very uncomfortable and I do not believe this should be rented out on here.. but I will say it was very clean..... they had an exterminator go in while we were gone during the day and honestly we didn’t mind but it was a bit weird they called to see if we were there and could go in the rooms I just felt very weird about the stay and it was a vacation so it was a bummer.."
18805144,213523090,2017-11-21,39768511,Katarina,"Small, comfortable spot located near Broadway. Amenities and kitchen supplies are limited and might rank this spot lower than other similarly priced options."

We had all the amenities of home while on vacation, there wasn’t a thing missing! Cozy blankets, dishes/cooking supplies, fresh flowers, soft towels, fall pumpkin decorations, luggage rack, washer/dryer and supplies, not a thing was missed. Not to mention, check in was a breeze and there were so many cool spots (breweries, coffee shops, diners) within walking distance. Next time we are in the Denver we will be definitely checking the availability of this Air Bnb again, would highly recommend Jen’s place to anyone looking to stay in the RiNo district for a few nights, or even a full week!"

Close to Downtown, Tennyson Street, 32nd Street, Sloan's Lake, and easy access to other fav hangouts around Denver.  The basement apartment was a tight for four adults, much smaller than the pictures suggest, but the location, cleanliness, and price made up for the size.  We would highly recommend Liz's home to anyone wanting to visit the beautiful city of Denver!"

There was a super convenient grocery store below the apartment. 16th street mall was a short walk away. The condo is a good central location and most neighborhoods were just a short car ride away. Carrie was flexible with our check out time and gave us access to laundry! The private bedroom and bathroom worked well for our needs. We loved spending some time on the patio, taking in the beautiful mountain views."

Only issue is that the basement bed sits just below the entrance to the house above and the floor is thin. Likely not a problem for heavy sleepers but the dog claws on the hardwood woke me up a few times."
4817072,87154318,2016-07-18,31377333,Danielle,"We loved staying here. The location cannot be beat. As for the house, it had everything with we needed. The kitchen was fully stocked and the living room was comfy."

Given the sweet and yet cool vibe, as well as the friendliness of our host, this was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences.  There is a perfect amount of space for a 2 bedroom and a big green space in which to walk / run just a few blocks South of the home.  There is an expansive back yard with ""fairly lights"" on a lattice frame - great for winding down outside at night.  It's close to *everything,* making it easy to get around.  Loved this home!"

Jerry has nice touches like coffee and tea, toiletries, and even some puzzle games.  The option to cook and put leftovers in the fridge is a bonus.
We didn't have a problem with parking except for very late on Saturday night when we still ended up only about a block away. The location is walkable to hip breakfast spots and bars, and it about a 10 minute ride to downtown."
28078819,553671049,2019-10-24,8039100,Amanda,"Perfect location for all adventures in the Denver area, wonderful space to accommodate a couple!"
21803491,469511975,2019-06-14,25660854,Nick,"My family of 4 stayed here for 2 nights after being in the mountains for 4 days. This downtown location is perfect. Secure building and parking. The unit was clean and had everything we would need. We walked with our 3 & 4 year old boys to Coors Field, parks, and tons of restaurants. Leons communication skills are top notch. There’s some directions to follow for parking and access to the property, but he made everything easy to follow via email. Highly recommend!"
592,2789114,2012-11-02,3992995,Charma,"Jill, and her stand-in host Carla, were wonderful ! Easy going, helpful, friendly, respectful of privacy needs, warm and generous with food, directions, jokes, stories, and tips about town.  I highly recommend Jill."
18963379,175380080,2017-07-28,44436574,Christopher,"Beautiful condo only a moment's walk from Union Station and more than a dozen great bars and restaurants. This place couldn't have been more convenient. Seriously a great value, especially if you really want a HUB to go out and experience Downtown Denver. Awesome!"
662431,154944147,2017-05-26,39432180,Tamenia,"The place was great! Very clean and it had everything you would need. The place being ""pet and pot"" friendly was perfect as well. Definitely would recommend to anyone and If i visit again and need to stay in the area this place will be a definite yes! "
15746223,151985582,2017-05-14,61471714,D.J.,"This place is perfect for a long weekend getaway.  Close to everything, but still private.  "
23258739,446916060,2019-05-02,257665461,Angie,We enjoyed our stay here.  It was very clean and the extra touches were very nice.  I also like the extra steps that went into the security of house and room.  Thank you
14630297,506576162,2019-08-10,93217996,Rajesh,Nooms’s place has great amenities. We enjoyed the stay and it’s very close to downtown. The sunroom was the best.
592,2651724,2012-10-18,145427,JnB,"Jill has allowed me to stay in her home twice in the past 2 years, and she is like a friend -- generous and convivial. The house is comfortable and clean, her artwork delightful and eclectic. Over the years I have had the opportunity to stay in cabanas, hostels, Samoan fales, world class resorts, and penthouse suites; Jill's home and hospitality are as pleasant as any I've enjoyed, and I wholeheartedly recommend her."

The place was sparkling clean, quiet and the backyard area was inviting. The 420 pantry is something that you won’t experience by staying in a hotel. Overall, we loved staying here and would definitely recommend it."

Everything was cozy and comfortable, from the towels to the bed to the little extras they provided (lovely bath products, a wonderful speaker system, and the TV setup). It's even more lovely than the pictures would suggest, and a wonderful respite after rigorous hikes."

26366956,492947556,2019-07-21,38976349,Rachel,"Yang's space was in a nice location. It was a close Uber ride or walkable distance to downtown Denver. It was also within walking distance to a natural food store which I enjoyed. The patio was nice as well. Overall, a decent place to stay for a short business trip, but maybe I'd be less excited to stay for a long term vacation."
23044784,294145545,2018-07-21,715696,Tallon,Great stylish apartment in excellent location. Joan thought of all the little touches that made our stay perfect. Walkable to many great food and drink establishments.

I would recommend Rachel's place to anybody!"

this was by far the cleanest airbnb we have ever stayed at."
4545539,225214666,2018-01-05,160667708,Jacquline,Me & my boyfriend stayed in Tyler’s apartment/ basement and we loved it. It was very nice and spacious. We had an amazing time there with our stay. His wife was super sweet and met us as soon as we got there!! The only thing that I would say is that be careful if you forget something... We forgot 2 very important things (our Yeti cups from a special family member) and we messaged him for them and we still haven’t heard a response (2 days later after leaving).
16811440,151421482,2017-05-12,129318501,Maria,Great location and adorable house. Wonderful communication with the host.

The location was awesome, super-walkable and close by to great restaurants, bars and stuff to do. The weather was lovely and we enjoyed hanging out on the porch swing! Street parking was also readily available, which was great. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in town!  "
34366188,528227543,2019-09-12,57652389,Alex,"I had such a fun time staying at DJ Bella's place during my short trip. It's an amazing value for being located so close to downtown. The old house is very charming and the room is furnished comfortably. Bella gives you pretty much everything you need, just don't forget a towel! If you are lucky enough to meet Bella, she's a delight."
22552157,302570983,2018-08-05,13583010,Julian,"excellent location and space. very quick to answer and to adjust when you need something. the space is a little smaller than expected so stick to no more than 10, and you will definitely need to bunk up. the place is a little hot in the summer but it cools in the afternoon. beautiful decor and ambiance in an excellent area. thank you Jessica!"
3183154,67912928,2016-04-01,20920325,Lee,"German's house exceeded all expectations. We stayed for a month and didn't want to leave. It was charming, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is amazing, with fantastic restaurants and parks within walking distance. German was a great host - very good with swift communication and accommodating when we requested a late check-out. We highly recommend this lovely home in the Highlands. "
34151881,477711179,2019-06-28,263242786,Erin,This place was super adorable and extremely clean. Newer building in the heart of the city. You have your own private entrance and balcony. Very safe and quiet. I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay and the price was more than reasonable.
10500808,83432818,2016-07-03,50954883,Nikolas,"Place was just as described, we were able to meet Emily when she allowed us to drop our bags off early. Great location got around really easy without a car.  Lots of things within walking distance including coffee shops, restaurants and brew pubs. 

All in all great place and great record collection."

14027297,305089961,2018-08-10,22453950,Lauren,"Caroline's cute and stylish place is beyond convenient to all areas of the hustle and bustle in Denver. I wish I had more time to experience the surrounding area, but when I return I will certainly be looking to stay again. "

13204273,236648160,2018-02-19,127588403,Roxanne,What a great place and awesome for the value. 25 mins to the airport.. 45 mins to Echo Mt Ski Resort. Quiet neighborhood. Plenty of space - so cozy!! And the bed was incredibly comfortable especially after 2 days of skiing and hiking.
9770909,402778990,2019-01-19,22099063,Shannon,We absolutely LOVED the place and will look for its availability next time we're headed to Denver. Great location with everything we could have needed and so close to so many great destinations in the area.
20772970,446963278,2019-05-02,78025378,Morgan,"Jon + Talene were very personable & hospitable hosts! We adored their intentionally curated home and the minimilist vibes. They had some rad tunes playing as we walked in & everything was clean & just as it is pictured! Super stylish with great aesthetics! It was cozy, in a central location to everything Denver has to offer, fantastic local suggestions (sweet cow is (Website hidden by Airbnb) & don’t pass up the golden graham or chai ice cream) definitely recommend this home if that wasn’t already obvious, we loved it!"
5508545,38829772,2015-07-19,19835461,Kurt,"Darja is a busy lady.  We honesly didn't see her much...between our schedule and hers.

The accomodations were as described, and we found it to be perfect for what we wanted.....a place in town that accepted pets, and close to the many offerings of Denver.  The bed was awesome...we don't sleep as comfortably on our own bed.

7497461,172057219,2017-07-19,12658748,John,Great comfortable place close to heaps of great restaurants and bars
18582812,480410150,2019-07-02,35966460,Cambria,Great value for a weekend visiting nearby tap houses and distilleries.   Public art in neighborhood and mural on house is really cool.
10995273,135877073,2017-03-06,111300715,Dustin,"Odd little neighborhood but the inside is pretty awesome, also easy access and parking!"
632709,430028901,2019-03-29,31241823,Laurie,"Lola Place was terrific for a week's stay: walking distance to downtown (2 miles or so), easy access to major highways, close street parking. Plenty of room to spread out and all of the amenities! My one caution is that it's an 1890's row-house with both bedrooms upstairs; these stairs are very narrow. This wasn't a problem for us, but could be for guests with mobility issues. 
All in all a lovely place!"
23001153,528266013,2019-09-12,151411653,Miranda,"We enjoyed our stay in this cozy little duplex. We never saw the neighbors (they were quiet as were we so no issues there!). I loved the washer/dryer as well as having a ton of extra little things that made our stay that much better. There were decks of cards, WiFi, cable, no shortage of things to do! It would have been nice for there to maybe be a fire pit out back in the space by the shed, however I’m not sure the rules on things like that. Overall we definitely plan on coming back!"
26109329,364919145,2018-12-31,87263483,Shishir,"we had a great time here, Uber and Lyft are usually within 2 mins away. the plaza a couple blocks away was really nice and convenient as well. very private feel, decently close to the airport."
28131765,431803790,2019-04-01,75927876,Kymber,"This was an incredible home! Perfect size for the price. GREAT location to everything I needed. Perfectly clean and tidy. The highway can be noisy, so the extra fans and white noise machine were perfect little touches to drown out the outside distractions. Incredibly comfy bed with the best pillows. They really thought of everything for their little AirBnB."
22889415,445167048,2019-04-28,4510317,April,"We were thoroughly pleased with this property. The hosts were courteous and had great communication. Home was clean and comfortable, we would definitely stay here again if we traveled back to Denver."
34210064,489376366,2019-07-16,99254527,Whitney,"If you're looking for a place in Denver for more than 2 people, this place is great. The kitchen is a good communal area and you can do 2 people per bedroom, which is nice for couples. They are 420 friendly and their back patio was a great hangout spot!"
590,17135809,2014-08-07,19367049,Michael,Jill was a great host with a very cozy home and very helpful to us roadtrippers (especially since we came so late at night). She checked up on us and made sure we had everything we needed. She gave us great advice for touring the city.
32304313,428234238,2019-03-24,148208479,Jennifer,This was our first time in Denver CO and the location was perfect to explore all of down town. The home was very clean and was nicely decorated.
9842499,533508054,2019-09-21,212870445,Joel,Beautiful home. Gina is very sweet and understanding.
7592378,104645981,2016-09-27,5821924,Becca,"This is a fantastic rental for those seeking a quiet, immaculate space in a safe and walkable neighborhood. I was in town for a conference and thoroughly enjoyed the ~1.5 mile walk to the convention center. (And if walking isn't your thing, it's a short and inexpensive Uber/Lyft ride.) I enjoyed everything about the carriage house, including the nicely decorated and well-equipped living/dining/kitchen area, comfortable upstairs bedroom, spacious bathroom, and sunny patio. The spa was a glorious bonus. Oh, and a really nice dog on the property! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you for your hospitality!"
10266757,91551005,2016-08-05,56362238,Will,"Really enjoyed staying at Jim's place. Excellent little studio, perfect for my wife and I. Very easy to get around the city, the light rail is very close and every Uber seemed to be $5-$10. "
3882739,180546022,2017-08-10,298064,Will,Nick was a great host and the apartment is very accurately represented. We had a great stay and will likely stay again.
6185753,124382194,2017-01-01,17266822,Linda,This was such a delightful place to stay.  Everything you could hope for was in walking distance.  The excellently equipped kitchen made meals with the family easy.  New Year's Eve was a great time as we walked the decorated neighborhoods to the light show at the Arboretum and then on to the Capitol to see Firer Works.
15098428,269060428,2018-05-26,190263489,Alpha,"The owner was very passive aggressive when it came to discussing our stay. He had a hard time expressing his concerns.  We were in town from New York and have a very big family. We had serval family members as well as friends  in and out over our stay. 

The owner referenced some “cameras” he had placed in the home. That saw many of our family and friends over late at night. He became very defensive and short when we tried to discuss “why”. 
Our family was celebrating Ramadan so we are fasting during the day and have a big family meal  and enjoy the family/friends late into the night. There was no group type atmosphere."
29706294,475692105,2019-06-24,193116368,Jodie,"My friends and I had the most wonderful time at Robert's place. It was a short Uber ride to downtown and I enjoyed running around the lake each morning. The place was super clean with fresh linens on every bed. There were 4 couples that went and we appreciated all the beds being the same since it made picking rooms much easier! The decor and furnishing was clean and modern, we loved the Denver artwork throughout. He had everything we needed to make our own meals so we didn't need to go out to eat every meal. I wold 100% recommend his place to anyone and stay there again if I find myself in the Denver area in the future."
5433111,40237694,2015-07-29,36533975,Nicole,"It was me and my boyfriends first time in Colorodo and Todds place was a fantastic home to stay in. The location was perfect; whithin walking distance to parks, bars, restaurants, the Denver zoo/museum of sience and nature, even Voodoo dounuts was right down the street. We loved cooking in the kitchen because all the appliances were up to date and it was very spacious.  They gave us our privacy but were still very helpful with advice on where to go and places to visit. They were even nice enough to give us their key to the Botanical Gardens, also walking distance. Definitely recommended to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay while experiencing all Denver has to offer."
13494022,242342677,2018-03-11,111563867,Brittany,This is honestly the PERFECT location!! It's walking distance to everything you could need. Place was clean and beds were so comfortable. It was perfect for what we needed to explore denver!
8211278,81478619,2016-06-23,27375986,Jake,The place was just as described and we had a great experience. Very spacious home and just minutes away from the heart of downtown Denver.

29300648,438043044,2019-04-15,241766686,Kim,"This is such a quaint, stylish clean and comfortable Cottage (Airbnb). From the moment I walked in, I knew it would be my go to location for all trips to Denver! Lizz was an amazing host and all the extra touches that mean so very much to make your stay comfortable (WiFi, music, tv, weather, recommendations for restaurants, etc...). You will not regret staying at here!!!"
11120331,530356465,2019-09-15,92598092,Kelsey,"Everything was so nice! Jessica was so thoughtful giving us a message for how to use things which was very helpful! The weather was still a little hot so we wished we had A/C but she did leave us with a lot of fans, so that did help a lot.
The location was so nice. It was very easy to get to places. We enjoyed celebrating our bride-to-be friend over the weekend!"
14055472,181856887,2017-08-13,36446942,Josh,"Everything you've read about Bev is true and then some. She's the best airbnb host I've ever stayed with. The kitchen was stocked with hot dogs, burgers, drinks, and a variety of snacks prior to our arrival. She's also super easy and prompt when answering any questions. I was on this trip with 15 other guys for a bachelor party and staying with Bev was the best decision I could have made."
22530843,531922137,2019-09-18,9169947,Tara,"Tim’s place is spacious and well appointed. It’s in the perfect Highlands location, within walking distance to many great restaurants and shops! I would highly recommend, particularly for small groups."
27174706,453349334,2019-05-15,45705753,Brenda,Zacks’s place was a fantastic nook in an adventurous city. His place was easy to come and go through a safely accessible system. Location was great and will book his place again.
39405,8985589,2013-11-30,1737913,Elliott,"This is one of the cutest listings I've ever stayed in.  Giovanni was so polite and helpful during my stay.  The cottage had everything I could ask for.  Jennifer and Giovanni were also very accommodating and provided me with allergen-free bedding, take out menus, beverages, access to the hot tub and movie screening area. I will DEFINITELY be staying with them again in the future. "

8718728,88802167,2016-07-25,3568242,Barbara,"The quiet room and comfortable bed were perfect just after a long flight.  Rachel was very friendly and left easy directions for arrival, etc.  Rachel has a home ""office"" for massage, so the only thing I wish I had done differently was schedule a massage!."
14488549,281283118,2018-06-24,3837892,Leslie,"Fantastic location with ease to public transit.  Apartment is very stylish with a great movie and book collection.  Check in and out was no problem.  The people upstairs were quite noisy at times when we were trying to sleep, as well as people using the stairs and elevator which is sharing a wall with the apartment.  Overall the apartment could be a bit tidier, and host communication could be improved.  However, we enjoyed our stay and would consider it again in the future."
8900843,309120099,2018-08-17,163756468,Blake,Great place in a great area 
33254257,559105486,2019-11-03,251412846,Maddie,The Airbnb and Katie were both wonderful. We really enjoyed our stay here. It felt like home. The place was super clean and had everything you needed. The bed was soooo comfortable! The Airbnb is located very close to many different food/bar options which made it perfect to walk to and from which was one of our favorite things about it. Katie was super sweet and responded quickly with any tips or suggestions or really anything we needed. I would absolutely stay here again! It was perfect for two people.

23684531,449531362,2019-05-06,239896941,Victoria,Great location! Central location to just about everything you could need. Fabulous hospitality! It allowed us to see Denver in a more personal way without being over stimulated!
15116690,148933949,2017-05-01,124492743,Frenesia,"Choose DaNelle!!!! She is so chill & laid back. Her home is absolutely great. This was my first AirBnB & it was a success. I felt very comfortable & had so much privacy. Uber/Lyft had no trouble picking up/dropping off with the address. I am not a animal person but her dog was SO friendly & chill. 

You will not regret choosing DaNelle's home. "
23019062,518502601,2019-08-26,72209501,Mindy,"Julie's place was great for our group of 4! The decor was very cute and updated. It is an older home, so there are a few little issues with flooring (weak spots in the kitchen and stains on the carpet downstairs), but nothing to make me not stay again. The kitchen had all the amenities you could want/need! The bathrooms were spotless and obviously recently renovated. Having cotton balls/Q-tips as well as shampoo/body wash in the bathroom was a very nice touch! The beds are very firm. The porch has bistro lights and is a very nice place to sit in the evening. The backyard is large, but not really landscaped so didn't spend any time out there. The neighborhood, although not the 'greatest' yet, is quite and is very close to downtown for a quick drive/uber ride. Wouldn't recommend it for walking. Julie was very quick to respond to messages, access was very easy, and off-street parking was a plus. The internet was fast. Overall a very good experience, and would rent again!"
13656290,107195554,2016-10-09,27844261,Patrick,"This listing is awesome, very close to downtown area and entertainment districts.  Very Private and comfortable.  I definitely would recommend it!"

24262468,359384962,2018-12-16,131089763,Kristina,"What a neat apartment! Located in a charming building, with two artist studios on either side the moment you enter. Checking in an hour early was no problem, and when we had to check out a bit later due to a public bus accident, our host was graciously accommodating. Book this while you can!"
33076734,450928132,2019-05-10,166632137,Cole,"Carissa’s place was a split level home, very clean and close driving distance to any area of Denver. We booked on very short notice and Carissa hurried to have everything clean and ready for us. Carissa and her family live upstairs and the rental is downstairs. There’s a little kitchen with cooktop, dishwasher, and coffee pot. There’s two queen beds. Nice stand up tile shower. Living room area has small couch and large flat screen TV. My only advice would be to have plenty of clothes or an extra blanket. The temperature downstairs is pretty cool. Only upsetting part of the rental was the floor that separates upstairs from down is super thin. 5 am is really early on vacation. Don’t expect any sleep."
22889415,419326943,2019-03-03,198691070,Kayleigh,"This home in Denver was spectacular! It exceeded our expectations. Every amenity was thought of(the house was stocked with toilet paper, hair dryers, tvs, pillows etc.), the house was very clean when we arrived and it was decorated like a model home. The house was very roomy for a large group of us, we never felt too crowed or on top of each other. The house is in a great location,  just a short drive to downtown or to local coffee shops and breweries. There was plenty of parking for our rental cars and Erik even let us use the garage. Erik, our host was also very responsive if we had any questions or concerns.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Denver. I would also stay in it again if I go back. Thank you Erik!"
13548312,489441453,2019-07-16,26840576,Leonore,"Great place, super close to downtown. Todd is a wonderful host, very helpful, accommodating, and has some great recommendations if you’re looking for things to do while in town"
15536986,213894462,2017-11-23,42878440,Judy,"Renee and Miguel's place provides great value and convenience if you are looking to explore the hiking trails, restaurants, and shops in the area.  Renee and Miguel provided coffee in the mornings, and made themselves available should we needed anything.  I would recommend if you are looking for a place with great value, in a quiet neighborhood, and close to many shops, restaurants, and cafes to explore."
31243020,456514158,2019-05-21,158446356,Chris,"Great space in the Highlands to stay, walking distance to some of the main locations in that area. Easy check-in was a plus."

The space was ready on time for our check-in and was easy to come and go without disturbing the host. Great stay and would recommend anyone looking to stay in a quaint, beautiful neighborhood to look here."

The LoHi neighborhood is a trendy area with many choices of restaurants and cute shops around. The location of this townhome was perfect, we were able to walk to our dinners at El Five, Linger and Root Down! 

The Townhome was perfect for us girls, spacious and great living room/kitchen for us all to sit around and catch up on life! The roof top deck was a favorite too! Great views of downtown Denver and comfy outdoor patio furniture!

Jordan was a pleasure as well, she was attentive to any questions I had even when she was out of town for a wedding! Would recommend her place time and time again! "

769437,5920385,2013-07-22,2302057,Dory,"Simone and Joel's accommodation is just as described. It's a very comfortable place to stay and located within an easy stroll of the hip South Broadway area. We liked the slightly edgy yet completely safe feel of the neighborhood, and Joel and Simone (and laid-back Lola, the cat) are great hosts. We'll return for sure. "
8941796,321608629,2018-09-10,157204047,Garrett,Great place in the heart of Denver.  Come at the right time and they might let you try some apples off the tree! Very calm area nice to take a walk in

756594,145273370,2017-04-17,119840830,Marc,Very comfortable and well maintained apartment.  Many unexpected amenities with access to laundry also.  Quiet neighborhood and great for walking.   Hosts are very personable and accommodating.
24334427,410162742,2019-02-09,235302800,Marybeth,Pretty good experience. Needed a new can opener and a pasta strainer! I had everything else I needed to cook and clean. Perfect for our group of 3!

12288253,128297715,2017-01-23,62182613,Christie,Great communication even though Lauren wasn't home. Her friend watching over for her was really nice and helpful. Was definitely a cool place to stay!
2267500,407001055,2019-01-31,68947434,Crystal,"Cory and Grace's cabin was just as described and had everything we needed from pots and pans, coffee maker, super soft sheets and cozy bed and a cozy blanket for the couch. During our stay we had a little problem with the internet and Cory was quick to both communicate with us and remedy the problem. The house is only 2 blocks from Highlands square with tons of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and fun shops. I would definitely recommend staying at Cory's and Grace's place."

14440882,516629320,2019-08-24,15760409,Deborah,Rick and Terry are exceptional hosts. We were greeted warmly and offered wine. The grounds are beautiful which offer a perfect place to relax with a drink. Plus the wonderful dogs! The location was perfect for our Denver visit
8686305,338170212,2018-10-18,9260369,Marin (Ivona),"Billy's townhouse is located in a gorgeous neighborhood, right across a gigantic park with a playground and a splash park. Since our toddler was with us, this was a big plus. The house itself is very clean and beautiful, just like in the pictures. We loved that everything we needed was about a 10 min walking distance from the house (grocery, pharmacy and restaurants). Billy made sure that we had everything we needed and more. Highly recommended!"
22596470,347065051,2018-11-10,123953604,Fabian,"A great stay in a great part of town, 10/10 would stay again."

4106247,505012231,2019-08-08,78365309,Lexy,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a week at this location and it exceeded our expectations! Everything was exactly as pictured, if not better in person. I loved that the patio was all to ourselves. The home itself was very well designed. The location was near so many great restaurants and shops with walking distance; super convenient when you don’t want to constantly pay for a ride. Everything was really between 5-15 minute walk but who cares, the weather was beautiful and very pedestrian friendly. You could walk downtown but it would be more of a 30 minute walk, an Uber or Lyft would be a better bet. Our hosts responded quickly and were very kind! The only downfall of the home was that our sheets did have some hairs in it that were not either of ours when we first checked out the bedroom and some of the towels were stained from previous renters. I wouldn’t have noticed but the sheets and towels were white so it stood out clearly. Other than that, which really was minor, I would 1000% recommend staying with these folks! 

You really can’t beat the price of what you get for what you pay!"
21924212,408794598,2019-02-05,166111845,Sara,Joy was an awesome host! We would gladly stay with her again! 5 stars all around!

23006749,243382222,2018-03-15,174650555,Ben,Great space with charm and good layout. Matthew was a great host. Great communicator and had everything we needed for our stay. Close to everything yet comfortable enpugh to have a night in cooking dinner.
4817072,25661141,2015-01-22,27621,Amira,"We had a great week at Matt & Mandy's place!  As former Denver residents, we thought we knew the area, but so much has changed and it is wonderful!  Great restaurants, shops, music, literally a stone's throw away!  Hip, happening pocket of vibrant Denver right outside the front door!  The home itself is fine, huge TV, cable, wireless, well-stocked kitchen with almost all amenities.  Large Sub-Zero fridge was great to hold all we needed.  The stove and dishwasher are older, and we needed assistance to figure out how to work them, but in the end, all worked just fine.  Being there in January, we did not utilize the backyard, but it is very cute.  Two chairs in the living room are well-worn, but with grandkids visiting, I had no concern of them destroying anything.  The couch is nice and large, as is the dining table - very helpful!  New carpeting and linens in the bedrooms add comfort.  The house is close to a busy street and apartment building but we found it to be quiet and peaceful - plus, the neighbors were friendly!  Doesn't hurt that there is a wine store directly across the street!  Matt and Mandy were quick to respond to all emails prior to our arrival, answering questions, and once there, Matt came over twice to fix the oven and washer and dryer combo.  Super nice guy!   I think anyone would enjoy their stay here and we know we plan to use this exact place next time we come to Denver!  "
17015278,256818752,2018-04-23,119651761,Clarissa,"This place was perfect! Great location, close to pretty much everything and not too noisy of a neighborhood. Did have some issues with random people coming by on our second day asking for someone. Other than that, our trip was perfect and our stay was great."
14423349,553667051,2019-10-24,63249834,Leslie,Very nice place!  Great location.   Very clean and nicely decorated.   Bed was very comfortable.   Ruth responded to my messages promptly. Would recommend staying there.
18250654,505065756,2019-08-08,342849,Heather,"This place may be the best private room rental in an occupied property I've ever had. The location is great and easy to find, plus right near a lovely rec trail into downtown. The private bedroom and bathroom are right off the main entry so I never felt too intrusive. And the hosts are lovely, fun, thoughtful people. I'd definitely stay again and recommend!"
14371267,313648093,2018-08-25,150694858,Holly,"Very easy check in/out, clean, had all amenities needed. Very nice place, I would stay here again!"
11722154,530461227,2019-09-15,276856241,Marcella,The place is nice. The check in process is super easy. Coming and going is easy and convenient. The kitchen has everything you need. There was a few games to play and a deck of cards for down time. Killed a few small spiders but nothing crazy. They do have 2 dogs who barked a few times but that's expected when you stay in someone's home who has dogs. Let me say that the few barks were not an issue. The dogs were very friendly. The backyard patio was nice to hang out on and have a few drinks. The bathroom was good. The shower puts out a nice stream of hot water.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend to others. I would definitely stay here again.
9169151,211664250,2017-11-13,2441315,Kate,"Great neighborhood, lovely little space with touches of home."

6913874,57033000,2015-12-21,16590174,Ty,"The place was great! It was exactly what was pictured on the profile and very homey. It had everything we needed and the neighborhood was really nice. We locked ourselves out one day and Valerie was super helpful/available when we needed her. The internet was a little spotty, but we didn't really need it because we weren't at the apartment much. Parking was easy, too. Highly recommend this to anyone wishing to stay close to downtown Denver. "
10392285,100938848,2016-09-11,72403340,Josh,Ben was a great host. We flew into Denver before our check-in time and he arranged for us to check in sooner so we didn't have to wait around downtown Denver with all our luggage. His place was in best location as well as very clean. We enjoyed every bit of our week long stay. 
6185753,330624417,2018-09-30,13030819,Kathleen,"Great location.  Walkable everywhere.  Lock box is handy.  Good space - especially for two women traveling together like we were.  Our only complaint was there was zero food provided.  No coffee, no snacks, nothing at all in the frig.  Food (and coffee) aside, it was a good stay and I feel good recommending it."
364585,9015314,2013-12-02,8583592,Helen,"A great location, it worked well for our needs Thanksgiving week - easy access to the Mile High Turkey Trot and the Wash Park/Pearl St. neighborhoods!  The upper floor deck was fantastic!  Nick responded promptly to our phone calls, and was a great help with our questions.  "
26562549,425170197,2019-03-17,239005012,Mandi,"Easy to walk to good restaurants, coffee shops and shopping. Stylish and clean. Just as expected!"
29187078,361507844,2018-12-23,125172995,Jerry,Small place but great location. Heater DEFINITELY works (but maybe a little too well). Maybe install thermostats for each unit?

32914437,452692070,2019-05-13,57147721,Huey-Harn,Great location and Olivia was super kind in letting us know when the house was ready to check in. Highly recommend! One note is this is technically a duplex so you do share the house with neighbors but they tend to leave you alone with no issues.
27631494,470065125,2019-06-15,262817523,Hill,"great location, excellent response time, friendly staff in the apartment building"

13815789,117083664,2016-12-04,101292133,Jillian,"This is a great place to stay. We were first time Air BnB travelers and this was a wonderful first time experience. Matt was a great host and had everything you need for a quick stay in the area. It was plenty spacious for 4 of us. The beds were sooooo comfy which is also a huge benefit. We used the outside area at night and the little fire pit area and heater were awesome.. Matt made sure everything was set up for us! The place was very clean and tidy. Fast wifi access as well as a computer and printer for your convenience. We were in and out traveling around the city and it's local to a lot of different things, a quick $5-10 uber will get you where you need to go. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is trying to see the area and have a nice homey place to stay. The only thing is there is no kitchen but he has a Keurig and cups there for you as well as a mini fridge. I could keep going on but you get the point.. the place is great and so is Matt and his dog!! "
21828418,546602481,2019-10-13,88693763,Paige,This was a great homebase for 3 days in Denver!

4753876,307603291,2018-08-14,172839668,Lauren,"We had a great stay at Ryan & Tina's place.  The rooftop patio was great and there were so many great restaurants right around the corner.  There is a homeless community nearby and we witnessed some verbal attractions amongst a couple.  While I felt unsafe in that area (couple of blocks from home), a block in the other direction are some great restaurants and night life that encourage a safer environment.  I would say there were some basic items missing from the stay (towels), but overall I would recommend their place to any future Denver visitors."
18227184,294131889,2018-07-21,178634135,Harsha,They're great hosts! very unintrusive and incredibly friendly

18582812,226441370,2018-01-10,55084153,Ashley,We booked this house the same day as our travel. Mark was very quick to respond and was very polite. The house itself is amazing. It felt like being in a cozy home but offered downtown life as well.
4978830,202283129,2017-10-10,28058417,Feuy,"Araceli's house is huge. We had a group of 8, but it can accommodate so much more. Great place to stay if you and your group want to enjoy the area. The grocery and liquor stores are close by.

I loved how Araceli is easy going. Check-in times and check-out times were flexible. We met us at the house to show us around the property. And there were no complicated check out procedures."

24868230,479997461,2019-07-01,24456495,Sai,Brett and Kelly's home is exactly as pictured. It's located on a quiet residential street with lots or parking and it's still very convenient to get to downtown and cool places to hang out at. We had a great stay.
23858844,294212649,2018-07-21,146236916,Beth,Nadim's house is in walking distance of many places to eat or drink. Very private. Very clean. All amenities provided. Plenty of space. Nadim responds right away to questions and is very informative. Would definitely stay at his place again!
3479122,504417347,2019-08-07,23397981,Alexa,Sam's place was a great spot to explore Denver from! My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights to go to a concert at Red Rocks and loved being near so many local breweries. It was easy to get around the city and Sam's place was exactly as described. I would definitely recommend this spot and stay here again when visiting Denver.
6333040,514145550,2019-08-20,156497647,Kelly,"This home is a complete gem. We were beyond impressed and smitten with the decor.

8686305,282543266,2018-06-27,71660266,Catherine,I enjoyed my stay at Billy's place.  It's a beautiful brownstone and it's across the street from a beautiful park with running trails.  The room is clean with a huge window that overlooks the park.  It's centrally located and easy to get in and out of. I will definitely stay there again.

1622963,112318135,2016-11-05,79673890,Dean,"Tanya was welcoming and accommodating.  She is an interior designer, and it shows.  Her updated and remodeled bungalow is well appointed and comfortable.  The location was convenient for us; in a sought after, historic ""Highlands"" neighborhood.  It is quiet and friendly, with lots of young families and professionals who value Denver living, yet a 3 block walk from pubs and restaurants on 32nd street, and a 5 minute ride to downtown.

20283662,273040747,2018-06-04,83474741,Ashleigh,"Jake and I stayed with Drew and Joanna for 5 nights. Both were kind and considerate people who welcomed us into their home with open arms. Both gave us great advice about local attractions and how to get there. We didnt have a car so utilised mostly Uber (about $10 into town). You can easily get the bus into town aswell. 
We would happily stay with Joanna,Drew and dog Tucker if we were to return to Denver. "

12685709,540027670,2019-10-02,173108383,Kristy,"Amazing space in a stellar location!  Close to many excellent breweries and tons of beautiful street murals, and just a quick Uber ride from downtown.  We had ample space for our group of 6 -- we used all 3 bedrooms and bathrooms, plus the sofa and air mattress and all were very satisfied! The garage space for parking the rental vehicle was definitely a plus as street parking was scarce during the weekend.  Also, this was possibly the cleanest Air BnB I've ever stayed in.  Would love to return to this place any time I'm in Denver!"
6348993,222076348,2017-12-28,53212560,Michael,"This airbnb is the best i’ve ever stayed in. The only thing that beats this place is how legendary Matt and Viki are as hosts. Couldn’t be more friendly and helpful. If you are staying anywhere in Denver, or Colorado for that matter you must stay here."

The kitchen and gas grill made for some great meals on the deck. Just a short walk to light rail and downtown. Everything thing was easy and accurate. 
4294257,257328975,2018-04-25,54723531,Kate,"Travis is an excellent host and the apartment is beautiful and unique. I couldn’t believe how much space there was! The space feels private, the bed is comfortable. I was only there for a short time to see a show at The Bluebird but if I went back to Denver I’d definitely want to stay again, for longer."

We had multiple points of contact in case we needed anything and felt very welcomed, though we never met anyone in person. We had breakfast and coffee and the whole place is beautiful. I accidentally left my phone charger and they were extremely prompt in letting me know and I got to swing by to pick it up before I left town. Absolutely lovely experience!"
18410407,334228025,2018-10-08,210827607,Saurabh,"I stayed here with a 10 person bachelor group in October 2018 and had a great experience. The house was ready well before the 4:00 PM check-in time and I was allowed to enter it at noon, when I got to the area.

The common area floors and carpet looked a little more worn than in the pictures but everything else was as good as advertised. I was pleased to find a bonus half bathroom in the house, in addition to the 3.5 bathrooms specified in the Airbnb listing. Each was very clean and had a good supply of the basic toiletries. The 4 bedrooms above the basement had big windows and received abundant natural light.

Chase and Sasha are helpful and responsive hosts. When my phone was dying and I realized that I forgot to pack a charger, Chase and Sasha loaned me one of theirs, which was a lifesaver.

All of the other guests loved the house as well. We were happy to stay in and chill there for the first night of the bachelor party, when everyone was tired from the workday and their flights into Denver.

The only real disappointment of the stay was that the cable boxes (and living room remote control) did not work, which rendered the TV’s unusable. We tried changing channels and switching sources but saw no content. So we ended up watching football on our phones and laptops over the Wi-Fi at the house since none of us had PC (or phone) to HDMI cables.

I did not try calling Chase or Sasha about the TV problems since my group had an outing planned. So I won’t hold the lack of a fix against them. And I’m sure they will have the problem solved before the next set of guests arrives."

25257591,559304187,2019-11-03,13999638,Dana,Beth’s place is great for those in the Lowry area or those looking to go downtown. I lucked out that her place was a block away from my friend’s place which was incredibly convenient for my trip. She was prompt with communication and willing to provide any details needs. She also had thoughtful touches like snacks and nice amenities. Thanks again Beth!

She was an amazing host and told me everything I needed to know and the hot spots around town. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s and this is by far the best yet. Her attention to detail was perfect. Look no further when you come to Denver. Very nice part of town and close to everything. I’ll be back soon!..:)"
31166864,507541144,2019-08-11,172530501,Ryan,Great place right outside the city. Perfect for a group or large family. Quiet neighborhood. Place was clean and exceeded expectations. Paul had great communication and was very accommodating letting us checkin early.

She has a really great home and the room looks very nice. She also has some cute cats.

So all in all, I can totally recommend to stay with her. You will find a place you could even call home yourself."

A great place to entertain a group of people, or a just a good spot to get away for the weekend, and feel like you are some place special. The host made us feel welcome by baking us some fresh gluten free brownies, they were amazing. They also left some great materials on the city to help guide us around. Everything was within walking distance for us, from great bars and restaurants, to the Rockies stadium and downtown. Really great location for any occasion. Will definitely be renting this place again, so much fun!All in all, great location, quality home, and great host. "
13548312,433476204,2019-04-06,104047211,Scott,"Dried food stains on counters and cabinet doors. Old dried out candy under the tv stand in living area. Zero toilet paper in entire apartment. Every surface dirty, dusty, or sticky. Mini blinds in every window bent in multiple directions. Batteries in living area tv remote control dead and not working. Bedroom television is just for show and receives no channels, but at least the listing doesn't say anything about there even being a bedroom tv. There were no hand towels to use when washing your hands. There were zero washcloths to use, so you had better like cleaning yourself with only your hands and body wash, since there wasn't any bar soap either. Similarly, on the bed there was one VERY thin set of sheets that doesn't even fit the mattress properly (fitted sheet kept popping off the corners), and you have to launder it if you want it cleaned at some point during your stay. Lots of half eaten food and drink in the refrigerator.

Great location in Uptown Square Apartments. Maintenance and condition of the apartment itself was horrible. Every time we cleaned something ourselves, we would find something else equally dirty or unkempt. We complained and Todd said that he would make it right at the end of the trip, so we stayed. That was a mistake. He charges a $75 cleaning fee and only offered a $50 refund (& this was only AFTER I initiated a conversation asking him about it a full day after we had left). After telling him that seemed unfair, he said that he would refund $75 if that would make us happy, but that if he did that we should not lower his review ratings. He said he would give us refund and he only refunded $50 despite what he said.  Refund SHOULD have been somewhere between half and all of the amount of the entire cost considering the condition and attitude. We even let him send over some employees to remove a mattress and box springs from the bedroom closet while we were there.

We were MORE than accommodating and it seems obvious to us that Todd is either incompetent, money hungry, or running a scam.

We have always had excellent results from using Airbnb, and this is our first negative experience. It was horrendous and I wish that we had just stayed in one of the local hotels. They would have been a little more expensive, but at least they would have been clean and had amenities and linens. Our first thought was to leave and ask for a full refund, but we trusted him when he said that he would make it right. Believing him was our mistake. If you do rent from him and anything starts to go wrong, listen to your gut.

This review is for his 1 bedroom apartment."
38642049,562278769,2019-11-10,18119914,Valerie,Great location! It was the perfect place to go back to after a full day of exploring.

521072,41402205,2015-08-07,37438539,Alyson,Matthew was a wonderful host. The apartment was perfectly suited for this trip. The washer & dryer particularly came in handy as we were traveling with an infant. Great location close to several tasty coffee shops & restaurants. Although there is no assigned parking we never had difficulty finding a spot. I highly recommend this listing!

747085,46956859,2015-09-14,930774,Michael,"Krista's Airbnb was perfect for my wife and I. The location in LoHi was convenient to everything we needed but at the same time was quiet and peaceful. The furnishings and kitchen were great and the suite itself was fantastic. The King size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom setup with the expansive double showerhead stall was perfect in the mornings.

I would not hesitate to recommend this Airbnb to any of my family and friends, the only downside for us is that we did not get to meet Krista since she was traveling."

21563426,475140692,2019-06-23,101759058,Mark,"Nice neighborhood and great host. Not for folks who don’t like Dogs . Buddy the owners pet dog is very sweet and tame added to the enjoyment of the trip. But he won't bother you if you ignore him. Close to the downtown area, and near a variety restaurants, shops, bars within a short drive. I would definately come back, Tony the owner was helpful and a easy person to relate to. If your the type of person who likes all new and updated 
kitchen, baths etc, and would pass the white glove test you may want to look elsewhere. 
If however you enjoy a laided back Bohemian life style surronded by artwork
Then this is for you. Good value."

The house is centrally located (and is very close to the light rail station if you don't want to drive anywhere); it's a quick Uber to the City Center, and there are plenty of cool spots to eat and drink around the neighborhood. It was also super quiet, so was perfect to come home to after our long conference days. Bed are comfy; balcony is really nice; and check in/communication was super easy with Jason! Thanks so much!"

10266757,208022448,2017-10-30,21063169,Abe,"This place is absolutely wonderful! 

Here's the nitty gritty....

1 - Super close to everything Downtown Denver. We rented a vehicle and were no more than 11 mins away than beautiful restaurants, awesome cafes, and everything in between. 

2 - Space! This was perfect for my girlfriend and I. Just the right space for two people. Excellent TV, couch, and uber comfortable bed. 

3 - Bathroom! WOW! Very clean and a great attention to detail with the construction/design. You can tell they put a lot of love in building this space.

4 - Safe! I read a few reviews prior to booking about people's concerns of safety....this place is safe. We walked out towards the downtown area in the evening, met a few neighbors around the area, and fell in love with the Denver energy. 

All in all, I'm looking forward to staying again if I'm ever in the Denver area. Great location and overall great experience. The host went above and beyond to make our time there nothing short than awesome."

Walking distance (or a short Lyft) to many different neighborhoods, super comfy beds, and I appreciated the amenities (coffee, plenty of towels/linens, shampoo/conditioner). Very smooth communication and check in process as well! Highly recommend."

31243020,537449088,2019-09-28,82085633,Janiqua,"Anna's place is great! Great location to food and local bars, very clean, and really has everything you need. She had candles, which was the best touch. They smelt great and made the place feel warm. The A/C is portable, which is not notated in the listing, but due to the weather, we really did not use it much and it worked really well to cool down the apartment."
26607884,326632833,2018-09-22,178962985,Kelli,"We enjoyed our stay at Eric’s place very much!!!

22884861,406473225,2019-01-29,112741250,Anita,The pictures accurately show what you’ll be getting when you arrive! The location is perfect because it’s within walking distance to lots of restaurants. And they put together a binder with recommended places to eat. We loved every place we tried! Having a washer machine and dryer really helped us because we wanted to pack light. It would be nice to have a later check out time but we rented a car for our stay so it wasn’t a big deal. Overall I’d recommend this place to anyone visiting Denver!!
4052272,331456214,2018-10-02,382160,Vanessa,"We loved this place because it was great to be at a place that was kid friendly. We loved the backyard, the ability to relax and hang out and admire all the hardwork clearly done by the homeowners. We also loved being located near places like the zoo, science museum and botanical gardens."
9169634,303604501,2018-08-07,96829141,Shelby,My boyfriend and I spent 4 nights here while in town for a wedding and continued our vacation beyond the wedding.

16589595,136972371,2017-03-12,71939451,Darcy,"This was my boyfriend and my first time staying at an airbnb. He was really worried about cleanliness, privacy and security. We were so wonderfully surprised! The hosts were really sweet without being too intrusive. The entire house, especially our room, was the cleanest house I have ever been in. Honestly, I was kind of ashamed because I don't think I could ever been that clean and organized in my own life. The room is down stairs and there are two doors, one at the top of their stair, and one on the bedroom. This made us feel safe and like we had a lot of privacy. The bathroom is massive. This room was nicer than the hotel we stayed at on the way to Colorado and I felt much safer and cleaner here. Would definitely recommend. "
17664945,191233962,2017-09-06,147353697,Lucy,Randall's little abode is completely lovely and he has clearly thought through making his guests comfortable. We were coming off a long weekend of camping and seeing concerts so we wanted a place to hole up and relax for a couple days and this unit was PERFECT! The snacks and Colorado beers were a wonderful touch. We enjoyed the sauna and fancy shower too! We will definitely be booking after our annual camping trip next year. Thanks Randall!
8941796,75080164,2016-05-18,35833734,Zaul,This was a great little spot on a quiet neighborhood street. The room and bathroom were clean and the space was quite comfortable. The keypad made access really easy too - no key to worry about. I would definitely stay here again.

We had about 10 of us on a bachelor party, and was a good fit with plenty of extra space for sleeping and to spread out.  Spent a lot of time in the backyard and great upstairs balcony.  The game room was icing on the cake.  Would definitely come back to stay!"

15534324,534386404,2019-09-22,2260127,Artemis,"This was a lovely apartment. I absolutely loved it. It was simple, clean and elegant. The kitchen was fabulous and the neighborhood was sweet and quiet (easy to park). There’s a fun street (Broadway) that has a lot of restaurants and vintage clothing stores. Of course it’s a few blocks from the freeway so it’s easy to get anywhere. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
14842171,497758950,2019-07-28,15492213,Dawn,The apartment was cute and in a very nice neighborhood. Michele offered suggestions of things to to in the area which was very helpful. She was easy to work with and we really enjoyed our stay.

33586595,483728577,2019-07-07,6928776,Garney,Clean and well-appointed apartment in a central location. Service was attentive and personalized.  We had a minor issue which was handled promptly.  Noise from other apartments wasn’t too much of an issue for us-  they provide  sound machines. Great place to stay.
24057621,434424577,2019-04-07,246085278,Michelle,This home was incredible. It’s had everything we needed. The home was clean and inviting. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook as well the things we needed to clean up after ourselves. There was plenty of room to relax and socialize. Rob was very nice. He answered all my questions promptly. I highly recommend this home and plan on using it again in the future.
24520787,479184640,2019-06-30,27835049,Chelsea,"Markus’ apartment is in an amazing location in a quiet neighborhood just blocks from the RiNo hustle and bustle. The place was stocked with clean towels, was decorated nicely and had very useful tips for the area. My major call out to future travelers: this is in an older building so come prepared knowing that while the listing says Air Conditioning, there is no central air and there is a window unit and a stand alone unit. It was 90+ degrees during our stay and even with the two units blasting and curtains shut, it was relatively uncomfortable. Knowing this now, we’d still recommend Markus’ place with the edit on Air Conditioning."
21726072,556051724,2019-10-28,217616722,Kirsten,Great location! Plenty to do around the area. Very clean! Joe was awesome to work with! Great for a couples weekend away!

It's a lovely done place with great decor, a small kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and sink and some coffee and tea for visitors.

Gary was very accommodating and quite possible the best host we've ever had! Also the fridge water tastes amazing, I'm pretty sure it was straight from a glacier. "

She provided some nice extras we did not expect. She was very personable during our stay and willing to provide extra service. Her dogs, Pepper and Bella, were even part of our welcome to her home! They are incredibly quiet and sweet. Thank you for a great stay!"

1327856,211417886,2017-11-12,24033145,Erica (Nikki),"Overall, we had a great trip to Denver. The house could have been cleaner (dog hair on the sheets, food odor), but unsure if this is standard when you stay in a location where the owners still live there most of the time. Great location and awesome living room area for hanging out."

Loren and his wife were also great hosts; they gave us great recommendations, were incredibly friendly, and even had a binder of local restaurant menus and contact information in our room, so we'd know our options in the area. I highly recommend their Airbnb, and would stay there again!"

A grill in the backyard and meat market across the street to take advantage of the nice weather. I loved the shower head. Lol"
1959836,120332194,2016-12-09,5043196,Stephanie,"I gave Anne and Ozzie's (her fantastic dog) location 5 stars because of I had a 10 star experience.  The place suited me perfectly and has a comfy and artistic energy throughout. She's gone to a lot of effort to ensure I had all the standards and some available.  I had one of the best nights sleep in years. The bed was perfection.
Anne is very cool, knows her town and articulates all the in's and out's of what you'd need to know when you have to hit the ground running. My favorite thus far and I plan on returning to the very spot that brought me so much happiness.

It's close to major bus lines but I chose to walk into the central part of town. When I started to head out I noticed the stunning Rockies right there in the distance. It made my daily walks one of the most cherished times in the day.  

The neighborhood is lovely and I met a number of people who were just as warm and professional as Anne.

Great experience."

It is close to all of the places we wanted to see (Coors Field, Union Station, breweries galore, shopping, fabulous restaurants, etc. etc.), and we felt completely comfortable walking around the neighborhood to explore. Patrick was an incredibly accommodating host, and definitely went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Next time we're in Denver, we'll definitely be back!"

30173198,487173468,2019-07-13,28663086,Patrick,A spacious and very homey place to stay.  The location is an easy drive to Red Rocks Amphitheater and downtown Denver.  Great communication and would definitely recommend!
20170743,529300883,2019-09-14,14511614,Andrew & Judi,"Good: Great location. Easy walk to the convention center and 16th St. Mall. Brady was very communicative. Great TV and WIFI.  He provided lots of chips and coffee. 

Bad: I had to wash the shower curtain lining because it was full of hair and mildew.  The bed and couch were uncomfortable. 

It definitely looks better in photos. It feels like they just threw this together with whatever old furniture, random artwork/posters and old bedspread that they had. This place could be so awesome if they just fixed all broken moldings, blinds, and chipped paint.  All in all it served its purpose for our stay in Denver."

17240910,171511891,2017-07-17,18278738,Dani,"This place is spectacular. This tiny home was a perfect bungalow to catch some sleep and the occasional nap between activities. Wonderful communication and hosts. Perfect location, never had to drive farther than 20 minutes for anything."
14423349,432341489,2019-04-03,62951658,Jeffrey,"Excellent across the board. Could not recommend more highly!

Access: From the airport, I took the A train to 40th and Colorado and then the 24 bus. It took about 35 minutes and was very easy to pull off. This results in about two blocks of actual walking, which is pretty impressive.

Apartment: Totally comfortable. It's a basement apartment with its own entrance in the back yard of the house. Perfectly clean, all the amenities I could have wanted and more. Plenty of space, too, between the room with the bed and the living space near the back entrance. Definitely big enough for two people to share as long as you're sleeping in the same bed!

Neighborhood: I liked it a lot! A lot of beautiful houses to look at. Right next to City Park, which was a nice place to walk around and explore. It's also walking distance from a strip of nice cafes and restaurants on 17th, and some more amenities on Colfax. Ruth also provided tips about specific places in the area to check out.

Communication, check-in, check-out: Again, perfect! Ruth was great at communicating and responded to all my messages very quickly. She gave extremely detailed instructions about how to get into the apartment and what to do to check out."

18273308,222415247,2017-12-29,26680509,Logan,"Nice quiet location, great walking nearby. Tons of fun stuff to do in the house, including awesome art supplies and board games. This location is on the basement level and the ceiling is a little shorter than I expected, be careful if you're over 6'6"". The only issue I had with this place is that there are no doors between the two bedrooms, just curtains."
4545539,83011619,2016-06-30,74227924,Vance,Very clean & cozy apartment in a great location. I will be looking for this place again on my next Denver trip.
37090673,564405529,2019-11-15,294962330,Alex,"I cannot thank Shelly enough for welcoming me into her home with open arms. My stay at Sanctuary has been a truly wonderful experience.
From the moment I arrived, I could feel the warmth and caring feeling this home provided. The feeling reminded me of being back in my mother's home. I guess that was a feeling I needed really. This place definitely felt like my childhood home.
My room was just perfect with a bed so comfortable I did not want to leave it most days. The heating in the entire area, including the bathroom, is wonderful especially on these cold days here. The kitchenette area is very warm, inviting, and provided everything I needed during my stay - the mini fridge and electric kettle especially. The back patio area is beautiful and I'm glad I was able to enjoy it before the cold weather arrived.
After having a rough go of it since moving to Denver, I was able to find an incredible healing and peace here. Though I will miss this place, I feel so happy for the next guests this home will bless."
14728998,508310941,2019-08-12,257254254,Winnie,"Steven's home is cozy, comfortable, and extremely clean. It is a short walk from Broadway, which has lots of shops and restaurants, and is also not too far from Downtown Denver. Steven is very friendly and responds very quickly to any questions you may have. In short, this is the perfect place to stay if you're town for a long weekend!"

It was the perfect environment for a relaxing week away, close to everything but far enough away to be peaceful and cozy. Wonderful neighborhood, great house. Hopefully we get a chance to visit Colorado again, and if we do we will certainly be reaching out to Suzie to stay in Mayfair Mansion. Thank you for everything!"
16273597,517677100,2019-08-25,57786726,Salar,Very spacious area. Love the concrete floors instead of carpet. Brett was very attentive to my messages. Extremely clean and high level of amenities.

26298683,410796910,2019-02-10,170430524,Macy,We really enjoyed our stay in Denver thanks to Samantha. She provided a welcome packet which helped us find some great breweries and places to eat that were walking distance. Plenty of amenities were provided and we were able to make breakfast which was a great touch. The space is exactly as she describes it and the location is great!
11945010,463613308,2019-06-03,256324733,Audrey,"A great, comfortable suite near Cheeseman park. Very clean and had everything we needed. We loved the décor and the houseplants!  One interesting note that may spare you some confusion: the old doorknobs turn in towards the latch to open- opposite of what I'm used to, as most modern doorknobs will open either way."

The running path around Sloan lake is less than a quarter of a mile away and a safe, enjoyable place to run or just stroll.  Downtown is just a couple of miles away as well.  We took an uber a couple of times and it was about five dollars one (Website hidden by Airbnb) reasonable and nice not to have to deal with parking.  I will return here every time I come to Denver! A GREAT value and worth every cent!"

Loved walking to nearby Larimer St for coffee, food, sunny patios, local beer and wine. Took a few longer walks to the 16th St mall and LoDo, but also super easy to grab an uber. I definitely recommend Casey's home when staying in Denver!"
32065545,508400858,2019-08-12,262271764,Chris,Frederick’s home is very clean and neat. The location is a quick Uber or Lyft ride to downtown Denver. Incredible value for the amenities

26453227,466815753,2019-06-09,92347203,Shannon,"This house is so cute. Well laid out and stocked so well! It is clean and updated. The host responds quickly each time you reach out. Check in and check out was a breeze. The location was great for us, we have family that live 1.8 miles away but it is close to Whole Foods, Target and many other stores and restaurants. We could get to the downtown area in 30 minutes to go to the Botanic Gardens and other museums. The house allowed enough space for my grown kids and us to stretch out and enjoy the evenings all together. This house is so cute, so clean and laid out well with recent updates. And I do have to say that having coffee and creamer there before you have to race out to the grocery, that's huge for us!!"

3150813,46748937,2015-09-13,2069448,Jens,"Mark's place was perfect for our group of 9 college friends catching up over a weekend in Denver. Great back yard, easy Uber distance to a number of fun restaurants and bars, and very comfortable even for a large group. Mark was a great host and was available on a moment's notice throughout the weekend, and even accommodated 1-2 friends with late flights. Would highly recommend staying with Mark - thanks!

20009659,512866205,2019-08-18,30111708,Tessa & Josh,"I was in Denver for a week for some continuing education and was happy to find Brooke‘s place to stay. 

She currently had another guest in the upstairs space, but I was able to have the entire basement to myself. This was very relaxing for me, as my days were long and it was lovely to come back and be able to relax on the comfy sofa and watch TV. 

The downstairs offers a good sized space to hang and store your clothing, accessories, etc. and the bathroom has a shower that Brooke kindly provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. 

Brooke was very prompt at communicating if I needed anything and we had a couple nights where we were able to sit and chat, which was lovely. 

I didn’t have time while I was there to take advantage of the outside area, but it also was very inviting.

I was able to use a part of the fridge and the kitchen for my meals which definitely was a nice touch.

Kaia, her pup, was very friendly and sweet. She comes right up to you and wants to be friends. 

Brooke’s home is a very close drive to the Cherry Creek area where my classes were being held. There is the Cherry Creek Shopping Center which boasts many shops and if you drive to 2nd street, there are more eateries and local stores. Her home is within walking distance restaurants, bakeries, and shops as well. It is also not too far from the Botanical Gardens and Washington Park is a beautiful place to walk in the mornings. 

I enjoyed my stay with Brooke and would recommend it to anyone looking for a home away from home when they are in Denver."
11945010,253497230,2018-04-14,36900281,Tyler,"Josh was helpful during the booking, check-in, and check-out processes. Instructions were clear and we had no issues during the stay."

9080234,317165460,2018-09-01,25314989,Wilson,"Tyler’s home is perfect for families with young kids. The space is well suited for a family, and the location makes it very easy to get to many great Denver sites. Tyler and Katie were great hosts and we would highly recommend their home for your next stay in Denver!"
15362044,197109660,2017-09-24,61563227,Nathan,"We had an absolutely great time staying here for our Anniversary weekend. Blake was very easy to get ahold of, communicated well prior to our stay and left a lot of helpful information for us to peruse upon our arrival. Blake even left us an excellent bottle of beer in celebration of our Anniversary! His apartment is clean and well kept, in a nice neighborhood and a great location (the Bicycle Café is literally right across the street and has excellent coffee and beer!) Both nights we took a quick Uber to dinner and by the end of the night, decided to just walk home from the Lodo area, because it really is relatively close. This is a great place to stay, especially if you want to get out and explore the city during the day like we did, and still be fairly close to home base at the end of the night."
16857174,215975976,2017-12-02,74682021,Craig,Rodney is a very welcoming host with a modern home in a vibrant neighborhood with easy access to Downtown Denver and surrounding neighborhoods.
28545094,546618288,2019-10-13,175962174,Alejandro,"Es una buena opción económica. 
El lugar es peculiar y agradable.
La hospitalidad de los anfitriones es muy buena, son muy amables y serviciales.
Te dan 1 bebida gratis todos los días.
Hay 1 restaurante al lado, el cual es recomendable.
La ubicación es buena.
Está muy cerca de Union Station, puedes llegar caminando unos 15 minutos.
También esta cerca del Coors Field, de la 16th street mall, y de muchos bares y restaurantes.
En general la pasé bien.
Lo recomiendo."
9201317,163898058,2017-06-25,77182051,Lainey,"Overall, our stay in Denver at Allison's home was very pleasant. The home itself was beautifully decorated, and most importantly clean, tidy, and well-kept.

The room was nice and spacious, and had a very private feel to it which was nice. As mentioned in other reviews, the bed was extremely comfortable! Bathroom was nice, and towels and toiletries were provided, which is always a plus. The room could get a little warm at times, but there were windows to crack open if needed, plus a fan to help accommodate.

The neighborhood was very peaceful and while not central, it was within walking distance to many local bars and restaurants. Also, only a 10 minute Uber or Lyft to all the downtown destinations. 

I would definitely recommend Allison's place, for it is one of the best bargains you will find in the Denver area. Thanks for hosting us, Allison!"
13972526,96823569,2016-08-24,88824974,Ory,"The house was clean and ready when we got there. Patrick is a great host. We didn't have many issues, but Patrick was ready to help if we needed anything. The house is in a quiet neighborhood about 20 minutes from downtown. It was a great spot for us, as we were just in town for a little vacation."
14369542,258826044,2018-04-29,118919094,Krista,"Jenn and Jay's place was a wonderful place to stay for the weekend! The space certainly exceeded our expectations and we really appreciated all the extra touches (binder with local tips, snack and coffee bar, etc.). Also, we can't lie - we already miss their adorable pup Ella!  We won't hesitate to book again."

13550337,224322742,2018-01-02,65465221,Miranda,Our overall stay was fantastic. This apartment is in a great location downtown. The place was clean and also had a great view. The only slight inconvenience was checking in by getting a key at a different location but It wasn’t too far of a walk.

7931953,88814991,2016-07-25,12517952,Candace,Kimberly gave us a great description of the neighborhood and nearby activities.  My only complaint is that we didn't give outselves enough time to explore them all!  We should have spent a second night!  
28660989,425095169,2019-03-17,195075331,Dustin,"A cute bungalow located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to good restaurants and shops. A minute drive to a hip and trendy downtown area. 
The house is very clean. The bed feels new and is very comfortable.  The TV room has an easy to use system and great theater feel.
There are slight differences to other rentals because the owners use this as their primary residence. Kinda different."
16733876,154085333,2017-05-22,126282830,Samantha,Great place to stay. Smoking indoors was the best part

1223612,53963814,2015-11-15,10873877,Nadav,"I went to Denver for a conference. This was the first time I ventured west into the US. I did not expect to recieve such a warm welcome as I did from Cynthia. The room was exactly what I needed, to sit and study quietly. The description and rules of the house were clear so I didn't feel too limitied or anything of the sort. Cynthia was always very responsive.
The house is located in a quiet residential area and since the weather was perfect I enjoyed the walk to downtown every day.
I reccomend staying with Cynthia for anyone coming to Denver."

The beds, linens and bath towels all clean and bright. I slept so well every night on their huge king beds. The neighborhood is quiet, lots of parking (plus a covered space all to yourself!) and the hosts were perfect. 
We stayed in contact as needed and as needed only. Which I appreciated! Space, relaxation and a nice cozy home environment...all I can say is PERFECTION!"

4753876,475108432,2019-06-23,244389848,Ana,"Great location in the Rino district and a cute place to stay.  Clean and cozy. However, when you enter you must go up narrow, winding stairs. They are a little tricky to haul items up so keep that in mind if you have trouble with stairs. The rooftop area is nice once you are up there but it also has a rooftop ladder that you must climb in order to get to the top. I would highly recommend staying here. Ryan and Tina were great hosts."
10494162,89794816,2016-07-30,19952515,Emily,Adorable carriage house looks exactly as it does in the pictures. Very accommodating hosts. Great location in a cute neighborhood.

It's less than a block off a busy street with plenty of restaurant, coffee, and bar options, but the condo itself was very quiet. The beds were very comfortable- we all slept well. The gardens were lovely despite a cold & snowy spring weekend. The kitchen has all the implements you need if you want to cook. I would happily stay at Nancy's again!"

The complimentary water, coffee and off the street parking were welcoming touches to weary travelers.  The check-in process is a breeze and the space has all the basic needs covered.  The space is small/cozy and the bed is a full size. The size us similar to a small motel room. Which for us was all we needed for our quick stay in Denver!"

The house was beautiful and very spacious. Very comfortable too. 

Would love to visit again when we're back in Denver. "
521072,35454969,2015-06-19,807762,Erik,We had a wonderful time staying at Matthews Place. It was clean and and very conveniently located.

Not in the heart of Denver, but that’s what we preferred and it took under 10 minutes to get about anywhere. The place was clean and lovely, and Caitlin was super helpful with any questions we had. If you don’t like dogs, I wouldn’t recommend it but her pup wasn’t aggressive in the slightest! Would definitely stay again."

I took advantage of the free coffee across the street and they were friendly, a cozy place with lots of warm sunshine. My son enjoyed his conversations with Matt. He even loaned my son a jacket and pair of gloves for the night game since my son didn’t pack his own. I would definitely book through Matt & Vicki on our next trip to Denver!"

It was very clean, and I had no trouble with my stay. There was one particular night where I did not feel 100% safe going down the alley to the entrance, but my Uber driver was nice enough to drive into the alley so I didn't have to walk past the people there."

Due to a scheduling issue the unit hadn't been cleaned before my arrival, but didn't amount to more than a couple dirty towels, some trash on the counter and an unmade bed. No big deal. Would definitely stay again."

33518674,496546401,2019-07-27,218957962,Samik,"Here are the Pro's & Con's

Poor Experience

The only reason for my stay in Denver was to break a > 30 hr flight from Idaho -> Denver -> Frankfurt -> New Delhi. I categorically asked before booking on whether I can check out late (2pm) as my flight was at 5:30 pm. I was assured of the same in writing. Host mentioned that I can check out @ anytime and it should not be a problem. 

Based on that, I went ahead and booked the place. After I paid and checked into the premises, I was informed that I need to leave by 12:30 pm. It was a complete reversal of the commitment. Was very disappointed. Had I known that before I would not have booked this place and taken the airport hotel. After I reluctantly agreed, I got another email stating that I need to vacate by 11:00 am. Even if this was an automated email, it would have been nice if I was communicated of the same before hand and asked to ignore this email. Host knows of the automated email, guest does not. I was under constant stress during my stay as if I am being pushed out of the house. Bad experience. My entire purpose of the break journey was defeated. 

For me the trust factor matters a lot.

Also the place is a part of the overall house. While there is a wall partition, you will be able to hear the hosts on the other side of the wall and vice versa (unless you are only using the basement). 

Good aspects

Place is exactly as per the pictures. Nice surrounding. 10 mins walk from Colfax street where everything is available (ofcourse you will have to walk on Colfax street). Rooms were neat and clean. Wardrobes are of good capacity."
13656193,438460475,2019-04-16,33104746,Debora,"Jordan and Jason were the best hosts. Super nice and totally helpful. The apartment was super clean and everything we needed was available. 
If you are looking for something near Denver. They are the way to go!"
5604348,40362869,2015-07-30,37716500,Magdalena,"Me and two friends have been at brandons' for two nights. It was just awesome there. The apartment was so amazing and perfect for cooking, relaxing, watch movies, etc etc.. brandon was so kind to us, we felt very welcome. He also gave us good tipps for visiting denver, because we as austrians didn't know that much about it. We enjoyed our time there and could recommend it to everybody to stay at their place."
3561443,37012411,2015-07-03,35109671,Marco,"Quite neighborhood , perfect location and spacious house.

18934488,527394925,2019-09-10,18880542,Nikita,"Todd and Will's place was an awesome Airbnb in downtown Denver. The décor was modern yet made you feel at home. Their place has all the amenities you need; the mini fridge/microwave was a plus. Also, really enjoyed the board games they had with my husband. Communication is 100% with them. They responded right away when I inquired about even the smallest things! Only thing is be weary of the street parking, as it fills up pretty quick, especially on street sweep days and/or weekends. But all in all, I would highly recommend their place as a perfect spot to enjoy downtown Denver."
8739814,195290774,2017-09-18,67354119,Craig,Great place to stay if you're in town for a Broncos Game! You can see and walk to the stadium from the house. Trips downtown only cost about $8 in a Lyft. Cozy little house with everything you should need.
35382615,499019930,2019-07-30,192363606,Amy,"We were so impressed by Peggy's place!  She found out our flight was arriving quite late and went out of her way and left some sandwich and other snack food for us!  Not much was open at that hour, so our 2 teenage boys and us were so hungry and VERY thankful!   The place is VERY clean and well appointed.   You won't even need to bring need soap, shampoo, bodywash, laundry soap, or basic kitchen ingredients or even a blow dryer unless you just want to! <3 The kids said it looked like I lived there because it  all the art, pottery, nice linens, etc.  LOVE!  My only complaint (if any) is that whomever lives (or was renting) upstairs were quite loud super early in the morning.  Kids running, yelling and stomping, and on the weekdays it was obvious the woman wore heels to work.  Lol!  I'm a light sleeper so it woke me daily, but didn't bother the guys! :-)  We were very pleased with the pool proximity (just steps away!) and overall location.  We enjoyed coffee on the porch and watching all the dogs and babies on walks.  Great area. Would definitely stay again!  Thanks again for a great stay!"

16087125,202503923,2017-10-11,45844462,Thomas,"Spotless with a quirky layout and plenty of space, this upstairs in a big house is in a fantastic location. It's a short walk to downtown and there are a ton of great restaurants and bars in the RiNo neighborhood. Julie is friendly and prompt with her responses. I highly recommend this space if you're spending a few days in Denver but want to be a little bit removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown."

25001622,307150662,2018-08-13,137929766,Steven,"Taylor’s place was great for what we needed, an affordable place in a good Capitol Hill neighborhood. 

A couple of things I did learn from visiting the unit vs reading the ad to help my fellow travelers: 

The unit is down a hall way that includes three units total, one upstairs and one beside the unit. 

Also, the patio isn’t very private nor is it smoke friendly because it is beside the air intake to the main house.

Overall a great stay at a great rate."
14042763,514182554,2019-08-20,57338156,Shannon,Cute house in convenient location  for many Denver activities.  Suggestion book was great and host was very professional in correspondence.
34205254,455500617,2019-05-19,85855926,Kasey,"Scott's place was great! Good location, easy access to everything around. I hadn't noticed it was a basement apartment until I further reviewed the instruction sent after booking, so the stairs were a bit challenging. Also, the bed was soft and plush; I typically prefer a firmer mattress. All in all, a great stay, and would recommend!"
32188472,487173903,2019-07-13,83732910,Abe,"Lovely home and gracious host. Every amenity you could possibly need.

21809723,246614030,2018-03-25,111169788,Monica,This was a cute super clean little spot. It's about 20 minutes from downtown which wasn't inconvenient for us personally.
21139957,210292216,2017-11-08,23672713,Dangsheng,"The place is new and very clean. I enjoyed my stay there. The kitchen/living is huge. Lots of lights. The hosts are nice and responsive. 
I would say that the place is too new and is not totally set up for a large number of people. Even it claims to sleep 17, it actually just has one king size bed, one queen bed, one double, plus 4 bunk beds. It would be good for one family but not very comfortable for multiple families. 
It only got one parking space and the garage is not easy to get into. There are plenty of parking lot around it but expect to pay to use them. Street overnight parking is not a good option."

Located in a really beautiful new building within a short walk or drive of restaurants, parks, and downtown. We appreciated the parking pass, which allowed us to park right out front. The space features a Murphy bed, which is a great space saver, but was not the most comfortable."

18753893,159350913,2017-06-10,5610468,Julia,"What can I say?  This was the best Airbnb stay I've had, by far.  I'll start with Paige -- she is the most helpful, communicative and kind host.  I never met her in person, but she went out of her way to help me.  She also is extremely responsive and her friends nearby came over immediately when we had a very short internet issue (blame Comcast!) so that it was fixed right away.  The house itself is a wonder, and I'm jealous that she gets to live there full time (which also made me protective -- it's her home so please treat it respectfully!).  It is full of character, thoughtful design, comfortable furniture, the softest sheets, and with lots of outdoor space - three levels to boot!  Not to mention eco-friendly and solar powered.  I stayed here on a work trip with two colleagues, but would love to come back with some friends.    Thanks again to Paige for letting us stay there on our trip to Denver!"

Street parking only. The bed is super soft so if you prefer something different, be sure to let Scott know. We definitely recommend staying here. It's within minutes to the Santa Fe artwalk, which is a MUST every first Friday of the month. Quick drive anywhere in the city. We didn't use public transit but I think you have options close-by."

So many special touches, like fresh flowers, well stocked kitchen including spices, etc.  We were able to make a big family dinner with no trouble at all!  We were so happy with the comfortable beds!  My review would be pages long if I listed all the things Patrick has supplied the house with that we used and were amazed to find. Steamers, iron & board - just so many helpful amenities!
And Patrick was a joy to meet and showed me around the house and pointed out helpful things.  The house is so close to everything you would want - great restaurants, targets, Starbucks, etc.  and very easy to get to & from anyplace in the Denver area."

I was so fortunate to have my first experience staying in Pamela and Brad's lovely Victorian home.  Pamela was the perfect host and very accommodating, even with changes I made to my reservation.  When I arrived she greeted me warmly and showed me to my room, where she had left a bowl of fresh berries and a carafe of water on the dresser.  The house is delightful, the room and bed are very comfortable and the location couldn't be better.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I'm hooked!"

It was centrally located it seemed, as it was about  a 10 minute drive to all the cool spots we wanted to check out. Some of the nearby houses weren't the best to look at but for the price compared to everything it was well worth it. I would stay again. Andrew was cool with me and worked with me on a couple of issues i had. He was prompt and reasonable."

We will definitely be recommending this location to our friends and family when they visit us in Denver.

We especially loved the awesome couch, the wonderful gluten-free delivery options in the area (Tony P and Subculture for the win!), and the convenient yard! Meeting the neighbor's friendly dog Buddy was an added bonus, and we loved the close the access to the zoo and park for afternoon runs. Two things to know - the alley we came in on is very icy in the winter so be very cautious and the internet was too slow for us to use practically, though we were able to stream Hulu - just with a lot of interruptions. Nan was great on communication and had someone we could text with questions and needs who followed up promptly. Also definitely one of the cleanest places you'll find around and immaculately maintained. All in all a great property that you'll be glad you visited!!!"

21447130,552006104,2019-10-20,24874700,Jocelyn,"I want to start this review off my firstly stating that I have never left a negative review after any Airbnb stay, nor have I left a complaint or been complained about by a host. 
I looked through the other reviews and it seems that overall Todd has been a pleasant host throughout his Airbnb’s listing history. However, during our stay he was not so pleasant. I’m not sure if our host was having a bad day or a bad week but the place was in disarray and he was difficult to communicate with.
I will just walk through our stay from start to finish. 
When we arrived their dog barked for quite some time. Every time we would enter or exit the unit it would bark. Every time we would take our dogs out to walk, or go to the car, or tried to evaluate the hot tub or sit in the outdoor patio area, it barked. I love dogs but it was a bit much. It probably wouldnt have been as loud if the ventilation from the upstairs home and basement unit were not connected because, that being so, it literally sounded as if the dog was barking in the same room as us, especially in the bedroom. Also, the unit is not completely separate, as it shares and interior door that didn’t even properly lock from our side of the door and had gaps. 
When I mentioned this to Todd I received little acknowledgement to my concern and was actually fired back at with a comment about my dog having howled a bit the first night we were out for less than an hr. to grab groceries. It was clear to us that our dog was barking in response to noises such as their dog, and all noises that were coming from  the upstairs unit itself. It seemed as though every upstairs movement could be heard in our basement unit and to an animal alone in a space probably felt as though there were intruders. 

In addition to a noisy arrival, there were dirty wet pet urine smelly towels in the laundry area (which I photographed for evidence) and no detergent in the detergent container to wash them and every single window/ window sill/trim was so filthy when I pulled the blinds up to open the window that I didn’t even want to reach my hand in to open it up. Not to mention spiders/webs and egg sacks. The rest of the unit had dirt on the tile floor and more under the rugs as if it had been swept under in a hurry to try and quickly flip the unit for our stay. The whole unit smelt musty. It was definitely a basement unit stay with all you can imagine going into that. The ceiling were very low and the lighting was awful, and we could hear everything going on upstairs.

After I said something the host didn’t want to hear he chose to respond negatively/ passive aggressively which made me feel unwelcome. In addition, I was having difficulty attempting to pay him extra money for my pet staying and asked for him help and he chose to blatantly ignore me which resulted in me having to contact Airbnb for assistance (which I got immediate help, thank you )

I want to note that we didn’t mention the wet/dirty towels when we first arrived out of fear of being blamed for them ourselves by the host and figured we would just wash them and leave it be to the past. 

We had to buy our own cleaning supplies and laundry detergent to clean the unit and the towels ourselves along with other linens we used during our stay. 
We left the unit better than we found it. We ran our own linen/laundry from our stay(sheets/ towels, etc., wiped down all the surfaces, (countertops, microwaves, coffee maker, kitchen table, coffee table, and leather couches were all cleaned and wiped down before we exited the unit... and after we left we were propositioned with an additional charge/threatened with a report and stated that the entire unit which we spent our own time and money to detail clean for the guests after us since it had been left for us in such poor condition smelled of urine and that we would be expected to resolve the issue monetarily “or else.” 

The host watched up walk our pets many times during our stay and we were home a lot of the time. Our dogs are both full grown dogs, well past potty training age and do not use the bathroom inside. He was just trying to scare/scam us out of more money. 

Todd also had the audacity to ask me after we’d checked out of the unit why I hadn’t communicated with him about other issues relating to my stay (such as a faulty leaking faucet in the shower that neither myself nor my partner could figure out how to get completely turned off. We chose not to reach out when it was clear I had been blown off during previous communication.
As a result, we were blamed for the loose/leaky faucet not being all the way turned off and it was implied that we were being accused of leaving it on ON PURPOSE.  

Whew. What a stay. 
I’m sorry to say I will not be returning and I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."

Afterwards, it was an amazing place to relax for the evening especially  in the back garden.  The amenities were thoughtful and lovely with many suggestions on things to do around town, and Samantha was such a gracious host.  The two things we loved the most were her french press for coffee at anytime and Gervis the Cat who makes the best biscuits and always the vocal greeter after our outings."

Just a few minutes by car to downtown and a short walking-distance to other local fun spots.  Safeway (on Federal) is very close for groceries and they have online ordering/home delivery. There were 9 adults in our group and everyone had plenty of space.  The decor and furnishings are stylish, yet homey.  The kitchen is nicely renovated and true to the description, the chef's dream 6-burner stove was fun to cook on!  Beds were comfy.  TV's abound.  My hubby and I enjoyed having coffee (bring Keurig-type pods) on the upstairs balcony off the master bedroom in the mornings.  The backyard is perfect for gatherings in the evening.  (Plenty of room to run around/play, and there's a park just a block or two away).  Megan was a very responsive host and kindly offered suggestions for places to eat, drink and be merry.  Check-in and out was a breeze.  We would happily stay in this home again!"

The neighborhood is diverse and lively so I wouldn't recommend bringing small children but we never felt unsafe. Loved the hip little apartment!
26336553,350153049,2018-11-18,131529264,Alicia,"Thanks for being a great host, it made out vacation much easier and enjoyable!"
33079766,448981923,2019-05-05,47494846,Terri,It’s a cultural experience I very much enjoyed.
26254012,467704701,2019-06-10,25969456,Andrew,"Simply put - this was this best AirBnB experience I have ever had. Stacy’s communication was quick and helpful. The building and the amenities (rooftop, pool, fire pit, fitness center) were all incredible and rivaled a 5 star hotel. Lastly, the room was absolutely perfect and the attention to detail and consideration of a guests needs was unlike any of my AirBnB stays in the past. Thank you Stacy and if I’m ever in Denver again you’re my first call!"
18775585,167442207,2017-07-06,115084957,Perli,"A perfect place to enjoy Denver! In a beautiful historic neighborhood and minutes away from great restaurants, museums, and parks.  The carriage house is a treat! Modern, comfortable, a perfect home away from home! 
"
37183949,560112166,2019-11-05,928530,Alice,"Beautiful space! Spacious, stylish, and super comfortable. I had a quick work trip, and Bobby and Julie were very responsive and incredibly accommodating. I would absolutely recommend and stay here again."
4263714,36930691,2015-07-02,35744747,Diane,"Melissa and John made me feel so welcome that I felt we had never been strangers. Their home is bright, comfortable and filled with stories of their own travels. It was the perfectly peaceful respite in a lovely neighborhood...I wish I could have stayed!"
28131765,443799789,2019-04-26,76986103,Emily,"Brooke’s place was perfect for our little 4 day trip! Located just outside of downtown Denver in a nice little quite neighborhood, it was only a $10 uber to the city and a $7 uber to the Lo-Hi area. Not only was the place sparkling clean, Brooke was able to accommodate us very well and let us check in 2 hours in advance due to early flights into the city. Everything was perfect, I highly recommend this spot for your next Denver trip!"
13724407,400336797,2019-01-11,99878828,Chelsey,"Everything was just perfect for me, if I ever stay in Denver again I'll be hoping for this place over any hotel."
16313550,196570617,2017-09-23,5570839,Heather,"Our stay was great. Quiet neighborhood, but close to restaurants and grocery stores.  Easy driving west to the mountains."
756594,131109180,2017-02-10,26737693,Rylee,Great find! Ling & Chris were great hosts & the room was well equipped with all the necessities plus more. The only negative was that there was a lot of noise from the upstairs of the house. Overall though I had a great experience & would recommend. 
17831437,152679551,2017-05-17,61134444,Amelia,"Great location with easy access to the Free 16th St Mall Ride transit, bike rentals, and in the Car2Go home area. We were looking for a comfortable and quiet area where we could relax, with easy access to any part of the city. Close proximity to the museums and a few local food spots. Will definitely refer to others wanting to go to the area.  "
29355346,421551719,2019-03-09,67440954,Patricia,Very well located close to the convention center. Cosy and well decorated house.
20932991,270238750,2018-05-28,3617421,Agafe,Great Denver home for a group. Lots of amenities and space to hangout. Gloria is very fast in answering any questions or requests that you may have. Would definitely use again the next time I am in Denver.
10927867,550968894,2019-10-19,201446551,Anna,"If you want to go to a place that looks like people go there to either have sex or get high, then this is the place for you. I did not feel safe, comfortable, or welcome there. I had been told that staying in hostels can be wonderful experiences, and this was far from it. If this hostel was ""upscale"", I do not want to see one that's not. My money would have been much better spent if I had chosen to go with a place even slightly more expensive. I guess that's what I get for needing to pinch pennies. I have a bad taste in my mouth for hostels now and never want to go to one again."
21042587,229789160,2018-01-25,682582,Eliot,Excellent house in a quiet neighborhood. We had a great stay and appreciated how nice the house was.
9665678,109009797,2016-10-18,99638658,Jacob,Great little place that worked for me perfectly. Tim is a nice guy. He was very helpful and accomodating. Great collection of old VHS movies caught me by surprise.

5010213,235182558,2018-02-15,76164653,Cathy,"Andrea’s place is very conveniently located and was perfect for me for a work trip.  Everything you need is there - shampoo, breakfast, snacks.  Comfy bed, a nice tub and shower.  I will be back next time I am in Denver!"
15282172,255827454,2018-04-21,83643380,Jessie,Emily’s house was fantastic! It was close to city park where I went for a run. I also walked  to breakfast one morning. Quiet neighborhood close to lots of great dining and activities. Emily was great at responding quickly & the house was clean. Definitely recommend this place!
9169634,557672263,2019-11-01,170954671,Liz,"Great place, pretty spacious for what you pay, has coloring books, crayons, a pipe, cute furniture and plenty of ash trays and  a large tray for your bud. Plus a great dispensary is within walking distance called Lucy sky, they have AMAZING deals there. Definitely will be looking into this place next trip."

7497461,70192777,2016-04-16,3493470,Tari,"Perfect stay in Denver!  You have your own basement studio basically with private entrance.  Everything was warm and welcoming and easy. Carly and Tyler's home is on one of my favorite blocks in the city. They were super gracious and communicative the entire stay and even let me stay another night last minute when my flight cancelled due to a snow storm. Would stay here again, no question! "
11690656,555472980,2019-10-27,286345485,Mary,"Although this is a shared space with full time tenants is the upper level, we were very comfortable. This host is respectful and very professional. Staying in this lovely older home really enhanced our stay in Denver ."

4638352,202541648,2017-10-11,11674986,Christian,"Just a few blocks from Tennyson Street, which is hip, cool, and has everything you need. Portia & Tracy’s place was perfect for my stay. Check-in was incredibly easy and they were extremely hospitable. I hope to get back to Denver, and when I do I’d gladly stay here again."

This wonderful stylish apartment is perfectly located in a nice walkable neighbourhood and is only about 7-10 mi drive from the downtown. This place feels like home away from home for my family.  Thank you for our amazing experience!
9731001,257301231,2018-04-25,166832830,Patrick,Great room. Arrived late from the airport. Comfortable bed.

22884861,336759915,2018-10-14,173746257,Amanda,This place is so cute!  Pictures are very accurate!  Communication for checking in and out was very clear.  Cute neighborhood to walk around in with a delicious coffee shop just around the corner.  Super convenient having Netflix available for when we were done exploring the city and wanted to relax!  Place was very clean and we had everything there we needed.  Don’t hesitate to book!
25457378,483701189,2019-07-07,46184708,Jeff,"Where do we begin. Fantastic location, great neighborhood, beautiful house. Great hosts & amenities. So many great eating and drinking spots nearby, not to mention the park right across the street. Highly recommended!!!!"
13271918,170500590,2017-07-15,2495634,Ellie,"Marin's condo is even better than represented by the photos - it is charming, well-appointed and in a great location. Marin is a great communicator and we would stay with her again in a heartbeat. "
2175370,16763837,2014-08-02,3294042,Tia,"Great neighborhood and Barbara was a great host. I stayed with Barbara for a couple months and everything was as expected. She had a lot of people coming and going over the summer, but the house was relatively quiet and a great base for working in Denver."
13993831,477726385,2019-06-28,60609051,Taylor,Candice is awesome! She's really easy to talk to and it was a pleasure getting to know her! I will definitely be staying again!
14058998,449428934,2019-05-06,5271716,Zlatko,Great place thanks for letting us stay here.
37972257,544686242,2019-10-10,71787704,Les,Everything at Stacie and Reggie's was wonderful.  So many nice touches.  Just wish we would have had time to meet them.  We arrived about 9:30 pm and had to leave at 3 am to go to the airport.  There's was one of the nicest places we ever stayed.  We will use their place when ever we fly out of Denver...
15486489,134535403,2017-02-27,81860136,Rod,"I very much enjoyed staying at Anne's home while I was in Denver for business!  Not only was her house beautiful and clean, the accomodations were private with all the amentities I needed.  Her memory foam bed with the dubai comforter was so comfortable I had the best nights sleep in a long time!  Anne was the perfect host and went out of her way to make my stay even more memorable. I hope I can stay there again on my next trip to Denver."
732845,277580675,2018-06-16,69801781,Sean,"Great place! Excellent location close to markets, bars and breweries. Was nice to walk 2 blocks for coffee and breakfast.  House had big open floor plan with lots of cooking space.  Would definitely recommend and stay again. Thanks!"
32085377,468142850,2019-06-11,115544148,Stacy,"This place was in a great location, easy to get around via public transit too! Great communication with the hosts and they were totally willing to provide recommendations of the area. The ceilings are very low, at 5’9” felt a little claustrophobic as my head grazed the ceiling, but otherwise nice airbnb."
9108143,116675664,2016-12-02,90516884,David,Another great stay.    For a second time now we have used Ashlee's carriage house to house visiting remote employees.   It has proven to be a perfect match for our needs.  Thanks!
20236195,517689033,2019-08-25,3178964,Paola,"Nice space! Clean, spacious and comfy. Conveniently located to great food options and easy to check in and out."
24247962,345708140,2018-11-05,61557728,Amber,Quick responses from hosts and a prime location to downtown!
11295273,182072211,2017-08-13,44219906,Riley,"If you're looking to get the most out of your Denver stay, I can't recommend Robin's place enough. Her and Michael are by far the friendliest and most hospitable hosts I have had the pleasure of staying with on Airbnb. This was actually my second time staying here and it was just as memorable as the first. 

The place itself couldn't be in a better location; everything one would need is within walking distance (food, 24 hour grocery stores, coffee, liquor stores, etc.) yet it's still tucked away from the bustle of downtown, which is also easily accessible walking or via Lyft. The private space is ideal for couples or singles and is very clean and welcoming -- you'll really feel like you can make yourself at home here.

Seriously, end your search here and book this place, you won't be disappointed."
6333040,268669907,2018-05-25,188900270,Nathaniel,Mick’s place is awesome! It’s in a great location and it was easy to walk to fun local places to eat and explore. Highly recommended!

8226466,51878764,2015-10-24,31924162,Joe,Awesome. Safe. Clean. Great Communication. 
23685442,456849532,2019-05-22,8088014,Marianne,Diana was a great host. The space was super cute and cozy. Easy check in and great communication. I loved all the amenities. Great place to stay!
7826191,78585224,2016-06-07,632202,Riley,Nice home and cool part of Denver. Will return!
629194,306429278,2018-08-12,136212634,Aaron,Juan was very helpful with his quick responses and recommendations for food and other things nearby. Beautiful property! Thanks again!

23381316,301741415,2018-08-04,98692209,Danielle,"Dan’s place is great! We came in late from the airport - it was close as stated, clean, and very comfortable! Highly recommend for travelers. "
15094515,149698891,2017-05-05,55326951,Allison,The location was perfect for accessing lots of fun Denver neighborhoods!
13550337,351704173,2018-11-23,13805843,Mike,Great location! Communication and check-in/check-out were a breeze and the parking spot in downtown helps a ton.  The apartment also had shopping carts to use to move your luggage and other stuff to the unit.  The only downside was some of the fixtures and furniture need some major updating.  The faux leather sofa was peeling off and leaving little bits on the floor and on my clothes whenever I sat on it.  Towel hanger next to the sink was coming off.  Light fixtures were cracked and master bed frame was coming apart.  Otherwise everything else was awesome and in good working order.
9080518,553654617,2019-10-24,40968778,Canda,Cute spot. We enjoyed the Denver snow and were cozy for the night. We hope to visit again.
28984049,538430158,2019-09-29,244227727,Amanda,Great place to stay!! Cute and quaint! A nice little walk to local coffee shops and cafes and a quick Uber to downtown. The best of both worlds. We loved it!
32359113,485932194,2019-07-11,15157982,Mark,Definitely enjoyed our stay!!
27763772,337591944,2018-10-16,1526654,Mitchell,Great cozy place with very welcoming and friendly hosts. Excellent location for any downtown activities.
16404214,350904750,2018-11-20,61454782,Gabe,Eileen and Roger were delightful hosts! Would absolutely recommend a stay at their home!
24520787,297875358,2018-07-28,203262620,Lauren,"Lovely condo in a very artsy part of Denver, would highly recommend! Only had minor trouble locating which building our condo was in because we arrived late at night. "
27432643,505086100,2019-08-08,32999074,Jesika,"This space is so clean, the beds are very comfortable and we loved every second we spent here. It’s about a 10 minute walk to the grocery and a 20 minute walk to the middle of downtown town. I would recommend this home to anyone. We have even talked about coming back and staying here!"
40266024,568552301,2019-11-24,100883435,Jaylind,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
28416784,431307032,2019-03-31,14175273,Taylor,"We loved Jaysons apartment! It was beautiful, centrally located, and the parking spot was huge. He let us check in early which was a huge help as we were checking out apartments in the area. Jayson was immediately available whenever we had a question! Would definitely stay here again."
21865783,318833561,2018-09-04,61131587,Rachel,"Ashley and Tim’s space was truly perfect.  We enjoyed it so much, we didn’t want to leave!  We felt at home immediately, it is clean and cozy and beautiful.  They are amazing hosts, provided amazing recommendations, were incredibly responsive, and are simply just awesome and kind people.  We loved it, and can’t wait to come back and stay again!"
4077803,172712694,2017-07-21,58938677,Oleg,"Great little apartment. The host was great, very friendly.  The apartment was great.   Just what was advertised."
4951295,62660831,2016-02-15,31359006,Juliana,This was one of the cutest most coziest of places my boyfriend and I have stayed. It was perfect. Has everything we could possibly think of. We even got to do our laundry before returning to California. Although I didn't get to meet our host she was the most accommodating and friendliest of hosts. I highly recommend staying at this wonderful little basement apartment.
20211196,431797417,2019-04-01,67978174,Cindy,Great place to stay!!
23626999,553241388,2019-10-23,56862116,Alan,"This place was great, the best AirBnB we've rented in the Denver area.  Facility is very clean and spacious, great location, couldn't ask for much more."
3968613,420789542,2019-03-07,89778661,Adreinne,"A paradise for artists, bohemians, and intellectuals. If you value aesthetics, visual stimulation, texture and fresh scents this space should be your top pick. The books in the bookshelves should satisfy any elitist. However, the space is great even if affordability is your main concern. Erika is an impressive beauty with brains, talent and wit. She is professional, organized and intuitive. We enjoyed staying at her home and loved the comfortable yet relatively brief conversations we shared with her. The restaurant directly across the street was my favorite food experience in Denver."
16392236,252939952,2018-04-12,63970156,Melissa,Stayed here for our last 3 nights in the country before heading back to Australia. It was so comfortable and homey for myself and my three children. We were so disappointed to leave !
28306141,516706904,2019-08-24,42915387,Kate,"We had a great stay at
Lindsay’s place. A close drive to fiddlers green amphitheater where we attended a concert!"
2467260,197989739,2017-09-27,18285135,John,"This was my first trip to Denver and Ryan was nothing short of a great host during my stay. Had forgotten some stuff back in Texas and wasn't prepared for cold weather in Denver and Ryan even offered to let me borrow a coat along with a USB cable I needed to charge my go pro. The location of the apartment is really great because it's off a major street called Colfax which has a lot of restaurants and bars that are walking distances. My only two complaints are that the master bedroom did have a slight odor,but was not a big deal since I just needed one room so I stayed in the smaller room, and that sometimes the footsteps above are loud. Apart from that my stay was quite pleasant and had no issue having my car parked in the alleyway."
23123917,302454581,2018-08-05,191063269,Antoinette,"This loft was spacious and bright. Lots of snacks and toiletries available in case you forgot something. Parking was a nightmare, but the area had food and drink options which were delicious. Grocery store, liquor store and many restaurants all close. "
23311357,351692733,2018-11-23,171113602,Alex,My family and I stayed for a couple of days and he definitely made it feel like home. He stayed next door in case you need something but gives you your space. I just had a awesome time
2119667,53006798,2015-11-03,29281182,Carly,"The host provided basic food items and COFFEE, which was awesome! While we didn't need the parking pass as weekend guests, that is a great perk as well. The house is in a transitional neighborhood, we felt safe and loved the convenient location. I would note that the bed in the bedroom is a full sized bed, so if you are on the taller end (as my husband and I are) you may want to consider that for the sake of comfort!"
12932332,486530864,2019-07-12,825528,Lara,"Rich and his place were great. Clean,  comfortable and welcoming! Nice, clean, private space downstairs (comfy bed), with access to kitchen and common areas upstairs. Easy street parking. In beautiful and quiet neighborhood, not far from restaurants and more. Better than we even expected!"
18753893,479375798,2019-06-30,35193092,Rachel,"This house is absolutely perfect for a group getaway to Denver. The design is awesome, house is spacious, location is great, and Paige is excellent and easy to communicate with!"
12990793,233240784,2018-02-08,64998665,Conner,"We loved Patricia's place! It was adorable,  clean,  and close to all of the cool stuff in downtown Denver."
23005566,282178304,2018-06-26,177361824,Julie,"Amazing location - walking distance to so many great places and the neighborhood is very safe and quiet. Plus, free street parking! John responds really quickly and also helped us store our bags for the day after check out since we had a red-eye that night. The place is good, doesn't get too hot in the summer w/o AC but is in a basement w/ only a single small window. Kitchen is amazing - would be great for people who are looking to cook often while in Denver."
30531086,538422913,2019-09-29,55896261,Ozlem,"We (two adults, two kids) enjoyed Emma's place. We enjoyed the quiet backyard space one morning. The neighborhood is lovely. I should have read the ""amenities"" section more closely to know that there wasn't a kitchen, but this did not impact us much. The place was clean and the jakuzzi tub was great fun for my kids."
22399469,230699830,2018-01-28,105107034,Esther,This townhouse was amazing! It almost looks too good to be true. I was just in awe from the moment I walked in. The place is very very neat and clean! I almost didn't want to touch anything lol. The area is very close to the shopping centers and restaurants. The host responds immediately to any questions or concerns you may have. I would definitely recommend this place to stay if your visiting  Colorado. Im so happy my family were able to stay here. Hoping to come back next year again!
29305639,475724901,2019-06-24,242900548,Chris,Ross was a great host and I would recommend his place to anyone
14488549,108637766,2016-10-16,85934354,Zac,"The loft was in a fantastic location just steps away from the 16th street mall! Very safe area! Alex is a fantastic host, and the loft is a very trendy. "
23999092,495923994,2019-07-26,83942545,Tara,"Wonderful place!! Right in the heart of a great neighborhood with beautiful historic charm. Marianne is an amazing host (who allows dogs, which is hard to find)! Can’t recommend enough if you want to stay in walkable Denver!"
16406440,324323640,2018-09-16,207369972,Justin,great location! food was easily accessible and very close to the house. they have everything you need at the house to enjoy a great stay. It was awesome and I would definitely try and book again! great hosts!
7592378,222037137,2017-12-28,163639281,Alexander,"Everything about the Carriage House was perfect. It was stylish, well-located, and had lots of amenities. This place is ideal if you want to explore Denver and then come home at the end of the day to a beautiful, welcoming space."
10161676,249112427,2018-04-01,17223917,Ben,"Lovely home in quiet neighborhood.  Close to parks, grocery stores and  shopping.  Nancy was very responsive and accommodating. Happy to

22825320,542617807,2019-10-06,29992016,Allyson,"Susan's little cottage was perfect! It was cute and cozy, with a great layout and perfect for a little weekend getaway.  The heated floors in the bathroom were everything on those chilly Denver mornings! The bed was cozy and the location was great, only about a $15 Lyft to downtown.  

The only thing we struggled with was telling our Lyft drivers to drop us at the alley so we didn't have to walk around or through the side gate, not a huge issue but often once you put in the address the driver was hesitant to leave us elsewhere haha.  Maybe grab the address of a corner house for Lyft rides? 

But that's not huge issue at all.  Tennyson St. was walking distance and had a ton of cute little bars/restaurants, etc.  We also were there during an art night, so it was a ton of fun.  Definitely would stay again."
7562368,545157004,2019-10-11,137144926,Michael,"This was an excellent location walking distance to many of LoHi’s restaurants and breweries. Comfortable bed, well designed master bedroom, and a small garage! What else do you need..?"

33343614,502552011,2019-08-04,173573982,Michael & Pamela,This room was in a very clean home in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of many restaurants and breweries. It has a great backyard with patio for enjoying morning coffee or evening drinks. They were very social hosts willing to engage as little or as much as we wanted. In room bathroom was small but clean and functional. Bed was very comfortable. We would stay again if traveling to Denver in the future.
21593370,536431298,2019-09-26,29181761,Stephanie,"Great stay and location! If you’re parking in the park deck, just be aware there’s no elevator for your bags."

12972487,97605058,2016-08-28,59047841,Michael,Tonya was such a friendly host. She made me cookies and was a text away for anything I needed. The space was very clean and cozy. Had a fantastic time!

21813519,468141974,2019-06-11,17643607,Meg,"Sean gave us great recommendations for nearby coffee and local beer, both of which were walkable from his house. Our room was clean and comfy, perfect for two weary travelers who needed to get some rest before an early flight."

2723629,21291124,2014-10-14,20901279,Russell,"This was my first AirBnB experience but hopefully will be the first of many. Ellen was a lovely hostess and her house and garden are a labor of love. A tranquil and beautiful garden setting with a loveable German Shepherd named Bhodi were just what the doctor ordered for me. 

This was my first stay in Denver and exploring the city from Ellen's place is a cinch. You can walk into downtown in an easy 15-20 minutes or take a reasonably priced taxi in for about $5. Bus or light rail is also near.

I was lucky enough to be at Ellen's for her monthly drum circle which happened to be on the full moon. This was very enjoyable. Ellen had a group of intelligent and talented friends over and I was delighted to be invited to participate. I particularly enjoyed the female vocalist who added a very nice dimension to the sound.

One of nice things about AirBnb is that you may get to meet other travelers and you are dealing with a person rather than a corporation.  Of course one must remember that for the host or hostess it is their life not the vacation you are on. Ellen is doing a very nice thing here and is very friendly and helpful. Please read her policies and respect them.  You'll have a great stay.

As a side note to the beautiful and bright young woman from Texas, thanks for spending a little time talking to this old geezer. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.
"
24120347,266269089,2018-05-19,137875589,Alfredo,"This place is awesome!! A nice view of Denver, and a comfy bed with a nice little kitchen and fridge is perfect for a weekend. Very close to a lot of things to do and is perfect for little pre game because of the penthouse rooftop where there is a grill and a mini bar and fireplace."
8444190,169775818,2017-07-13,138072548,Matthew,Dunkin Doughnuts right next door for early morning coffee!  Walking distance to many restaurants.
20680884,298698717,2018-07-29,58739897,Michael,Really cool condo a short walk or Uber to a ton of things to do downtown. Kaitlin was great and easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend! 
7577128,313625915,2018-08-25,118745194,Amy,"Had a wonderful time at Jeff and JP’s place! House was exactly as expected and hanging out on the front porch was our absolute favorite! Area is up and coming but was totally fine to walk around in, even at night. It was in close walking distance to a lot of cute bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and shops. We really loved exploring that area!"
11945010,210305345,2017-11-08,19058732,Sarah,"Very clean, nicely designed apartment with easy to use pull out couch in living room to make an extra bedroom. Nice walkable neighborhood. Josh was very welcoming and accommodating. And the apartment is family friendly. We stayed there with our 1 year old son"
31587928,514708135,2019-08-21,275644067,Dahyuan,Christoper is a great host. The private setting is good for relaxing without disturbance. Christopher’s place will be our first choice if we ever visit Denver again.
10927816,486469679,2019-07-12,156923246,Mina,"Great location, nice and neat place and very authentic. Great hospitality too. I enjoyed staying here. I highly recommend this hostel!"
9433028,505009023,2019-08-08,9508976,Karla,"Roomy venue close to downtown and other popular areas.  Easy access, no parking issues and full kitchen.   Thank you for a great stay!"
23189744,337204752,2018-10-15,215613397,Connie,"Jennifer was very responsive and provided us with amazing tips for food and entertainment in the area.  Her home was comfy and cozy and she provided us with all the necessities needed (shampoo/ conditioner,  towels,  toiletries, dish soap etc.) Her cats were both friendly and very enjoyable.  I would highly recommend staying at Jennifer's home."
25458868,335999112,2018-10-13,136283472,Amanda,"Clean, comfortable, and private entrance. Emily is obviously an experienced host and we had a nice stay here. The location is good with some restaurants in walking distance."

26062987,453759770,2019-05-16,187521916,Raymundo,"Close to DIA, grocery shopping near by and the hospitality from the home owners to the neighbors was icing on the cake. Highly recommend this place to a large group."
1891877,36464490,2015-06-28,32677479,Nicholas,"Cathy is friendly and welcoming, her dog is playful, and her house is in a cute neighborhood with good access (by car or other transportation) to downtown. The upstairs of the house is nice and well-maintained. Unfortunately, the quality of the guest sleeping area is disappointing, and its cleanliness was well below our expectations. The bedroom is tucked behind the laundry room in a partially finished basement in an early 20th century house. The steps down to the basement are very shallow, so you need to place your feet sideways to walk down safely. The ceiling height is around 6' 6"" but you have to enter the room below ductwork that's less than 6' off the floor. The bedding was clean but the room had clearly not been cleaned - dead insects and heavy dust covered the horizontal surfaces. The sitting room (where our kids slept) had both stained carpet and futon, torn sheets and blanket, dead insects, and dog hair. The basement is cooler than the rest of the house, but it was stuffy as there are no functional (or egress) windows. The washer and dryer worked well. We were supposed to stay 3 nights but left a day early since we didn't feel comfortable there. If the downstairs had been appropriately cleaned, we probably would have had a much better experience and would have viewed the house's structural limitations as character."
24856267,405720707,2019-01-27,5280441,Rick,"Luba was a great host and the place was amazing. The hot tub was already heated when we arrived, and everything was clean and well stocked!"
4719119,462040181,2019-06-01,215979825,Anthony,We enjoyed our stay!
21463028,323441219,2018-09-15,9843229,Brittany,This place was AMAZING!!! All of my friends who stayed here with me kept saying how gorgeous the house was and how much they wished they could live in the house forever. The finishes picked out and design style for this house made for an incredibly comfortable stay. It was spotless clean and exactly as advertised. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!!
15800346,151391237,2017-05-12,120773431,Amanda,"Location is great and kitchen is fully stocked which is awesome. Sarsha was great with communication.  Overall great stay but with two comments. The bed is very firm but that is a personal preference. Also, Sarsha very kindly tried to assist by laying down an extra rug but you can hear all movements from the apartment above."
23748316,470875950,2019-06-16,20303022,Nicole,Great place at a perfect location. Bars and Restaurants just around the corner in a really nice neighborhood. Walkable distance to Denver DT. Would definitely come again on my next trip to Denver!
7116284,42704275,2015-08-15,2531465,Neil,"Wonderful experience.  Stayed in the shady retreat which was a spacious, clean, comfortable basement suite. Jennifer is a gracious and accommodating host, and I would definitely stay here again. "
5070640,76855376,2016-05-29,62531863,Eric,"Traveled to Denver for a weekend trip. My wife and I absolutely loved this house. All the details you see in the photos are 100% accurate, it was clean, quiet, and cozy. We particularly enjoyed it's proximity to the shops and restaurants in the West Highlands area. Would highly recommend staying here.  "
9080518,516636652,2019-08-24,891575,Leora,"Pretty much as described. Back patio looks better in the photos. Great location, good value. We didn’t realize there’s no kitchen. There is a small fridge and microwave."
19436429,517617422,2019-08-25,53602652,Chelsea,Emmy and Cameron were phenomenal hosts. They were super responsive from the very beginning and offered lots of tips to make our trip a smooth one. The house looks like it’s straight out of HGTV and the backyard area was perfect for entertaining. We loved staying at the Hip Bungalow and would absolutely book it again on a return trip to Denver!
1733052,64532750,2016-03-05,57461229,Barry,Jason and Vibeke were amazing. Great flexible hosts who provided us with everything we needed and more. Great space in a nice area that is easily walkable to many restaurants and entertainment. 
13041992,208023909,2017-10-30,41508414,Kaley,"Jack was a wonderful host! Communication was phenomenal- he even met us as we pulled up to make sure we were settled. I wish we would have been able to stay longer than one night. If you’re traveling to Denver, definitely give this place a shot! We didn’t want to leave."
19293155,197740459,2017-09-26,21098365,Alicia,"This place is by far the best Airbnb we've ever stayed in.  It was incredibly clean and comfortable and offered multiple amenities not normally available (e.g., a ""mini-bar"" with food and drinks for purchase and some basic toiletries).  The location was easily accessible to everything we wanted to do for the weekend and it was fantastic to have an off-street parking spot.  The only two things to note: the bed is very soft and feels a bit smaller than a queen for those who are picky sleepers and the upstairs neighbor was a little noisier than anticipated.  Overall, we had a great experience and Allan is a great and informative host.  We highly recommend and would definitely stay here again in the future."
24060173,312108803,2018-08-22,62587066,Fiona,Great location and good communication with host. The beds really need a lot of work to feel any sort of comfort. The shower was really could use a deep clean.
9770909,115205525,2016-11-22,43870504,Chelsea,"This was the perfect house for my sister and I to stay for our first trip to Denver!  It's in a great location.  We were able to park our car right by the house, and getting to downtown was quick and convenient!  Yousef provided an informative book for our use, which was extremely helpful!  I would definitely book again!"
16066443,273026981,2018-06-04,168358436,Karen,"Alojamiento con muy buena limpieza, con todo lo indispensable para hospedarte(Wi-fi, TV, roku, netflix).
Muy cerca del centro de Denver.
Por parte del anfitrión con una rápida y muy buena respuesta de atención y servicio.
Thank you so much Brad "
3395085,517825018,2019-08-25,234364605,Geert,"Nice place close to downtown and interstate to the mountains. Great hospitality and communication. The dog is adorable and super easy, for me a pre for the stay. Know that you will hear the sound of traffic. If you are very sensitive for noise bring earplugs. For me it was the only thing that could have made my stay even better but I would go again, no doubt."
632709,207758272,2017-10-29,61551997,Lorie,"Private, quiet, quaint!"
21080559,242394679,2018-03-11,75416234,Joshua,Brad was very helpful with finding awesome things to do around Denver and the place was wonderful.
14042383,315008046,2018-08-27,25455040,Kent,Very nice place with great view of the city and ideal location.  Right on 16th street and easy walk to other nice parts of the city.  We rented a car and having a parking spot in the building was a huge convenience.  Highly recommend!
1557739,131779692,2017-02-13,5212583,Rob,Nice clean room in a great location walking distance from RiNo. 
20419783,413648075,2019-02-17,141195320,Jesse,"Dales place is very clean and simple. If you're looking for extravagance look elsewhere. If you want a simple place to be comfortable and kick your feet up, this is it. Has all the kitchen appliances you need. The space is comfortable enough for about 4-5 people with the draw back being the one bathroom. The last thing i would like to warn about is the noise from the street. If its something your used to you will have no problems. Otherwise bring some ear plugs. All in all my guests and I had a great stay at dales place and i would definitely stay here again."
14932614,124354803,2017-01-01,68914868,Josh,"About a 5 minute ride from downtown, this was a perfect place to stay for the weekend. Well equipped with anything we could possibly need. Also had a large back yard which was perfect for our dogs. Overall, a great place to stay in Denver. "
8718728,562943128,2019-11-11,251803492,Stephen,"If you love a cozy home feel, great restaurant recommendations, and an impeccable host, come see the Dahlia house!"
1959918,39022330,2015-07-20,33108207,Zeina,"This was our first time using airbnb and we were very impressed! The home was well stocked with all essentials, and was very clean. As mentioned in prior reviews, we were able to get an uber ride just about everywhere for $5. We did notice the smoke smell in the home - we bought a glade candle, which eliminated the smell quickly. We weren't able to hold our luggage at the home prior to our evening departure flight, however, we found that the Hyatt Regency downtown was willing to hold it for us - we just tipped the staff. Overall, I would highly recommend this home and will definitely be using airbnb again!"
21667826,224293048,2018-01-02,76812883,Freddy,"Simon and Aurora’s cottage was the best! The place is brand new and very stylish. It sits behind the main house and is very private. We loved the large windows and natural light in the space. The apartment had all the amenities you could need and was stocked with snacks, beer, and even a bottle of champagne to ring in the new year. It far exceeded our expectations and consider it among the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at. The location was great too! We loved walking around the RINO district and downtown was a just a short uber away. We can’t wait to go back!"
22889415,530970472,2019-09-16,61142702,Jordan,The house was better than we could imagine. Plenty of space for privacy and to spend time together. We would definitely stay here again.
31536734,459800333,2019-05-27,261433045,Alisha,Brandon’s house was so cozy and relaxing. The neighborhood was very nice and quite. The backyard was our favorite place to be we had bonfires. We will for sure be rent his place again when we come to Denver again!!!!
18582812,498387625,2019-07-29,65979733,Alissa,Great location in the art district of Rino. Walking distance to all the great restaurants and a ton of artwork in the area to observe.
5508545,279772111,2018-06-21,102159305,Adam,"This place is great! Quick communication, outstanding hospitality, and perfect for a Denver getaway. This place was exactly what we needed and Darja went above and beyond to see we were comfortable. She’s knowledgeable of the city, which only made the stay better!"
17664945,172731271,2017-07-21,128041306,Cassandra,"Randall was, without a doubt, the most gracious and accommodating host I have ever had. Check in and out were a breeze, and we were welcomed into a clean, homey studio full of toiletries, album and book selections, snacks, breakfast burritos, waters, and local beers, wines and spirits. He also provided a binder of local recommendations. He is respectful of your space, but also very happy to chat if you're looking for company and someone to share a bottle of wine with on the porch. I would recommend this space for an extended stay (we were only there for two nights), because I feel like you could really feel at home. Thank you, Randall!"
9770909,76469360,2016-05-27,22206772,Nicole,"My boyfriend and I spent our first night in Colorado here. Because we got in so late, the combination code lock made it easy for us to get in without having to disturb Yousef! It was very convenient and super cozy inside! The kitchen was equipped with utensils, and the bathroom had towels, shampoo, conditioner, etc. The bedroom was cozy and the heater definitely came in handy! Although we didn't get to use it, the backyard was nice too. Thanks Yousef, for a cozy stay in the Arts District in Denver! And thanks for offering so many great suggestions for our trip and always getting back to me so quickly!"
14946195,162873172,2017-06-22,99526858,Rachel,"This was a great find!!  Steve is a friendly, helpful host, and the tiny house is convenient, secure, and so cute and comfortable!  We were able to spend our days out and about hiking and enjoying some day trips, and we spent our evenings cooking and hanging out on the patio, and it all felt like a home away from home.  The house is clean, well-stocked, and stylish, and Steve was there to meet us and available to answer any questions that came up.  We'll be looking at this place first next time we come to CO!"
13494022,189731502,2017-09-02,2830406,Jackie,"The location was great but the downstairs flat where we slept was not quite what we had expected from the description or photographs. It is in the basement and the windows are below ground level making it fairly dark. The air-con was set at 68 and there was no separate control in the basement so it was also a little chilly. We felt the area was rather small for 4 adults with cases. You couldn't 'hang around' in it. On re-reading the description it is clear that we also could have used the upstairs main lounge and kitchen, which was very nice. We had not realised this and had just spotted that the fridge was full to capacity with someone's stuff which we assumed was the owners. Although I cant say it was expensive , we did pay quite a lot more for this place than we paid for full use of a significantly larger airbnb flat in the same area just the week before."

33704620,494672547,2019-07-24,81343257,Lindsey,Matt and his wife were great hosts! They even let us use some of their dishes and cookware. Very convenient to the airport and their place was spotless! We liked staying here better than staying at a hotel.
38551000,559135634,2019-11-03,45914978,Brandy,"Very comfortable accommodations with great amenities. The neighborhood has several nearby options for food/coffee/drinks, and the apartment features a nice kitchen with everything you need if you'd rather stay in.

6410804,87509829,2016-07-20,47984336,Marlene,"Staying in the upstairs loft at Jerry's condo was a beyond lovely experience! Jerry was a pleasure to meet and stay with. The bed upstairs was as described and the bathroom was roomy and stocked with extra supplies if we needed it! He provided us the pool key (we didn't end up using) and a key to his condo which let us get in and out as we needed. On a day we got stuck in the rain he let us use his dryer, he had water and strawberry lemonade in the fridge, and he made us cookies one day! He also laid out an extra sheet when I requested to sleep on his couch if I needed my own bed (my friend is a light sleeper). I accidentally left an item behind at his house and he was so fast to inform me and offer to mail it!  It couldn't have gone better staying here!"
21228203,466799237,2019-06-09,157680818,Veronica,"My sister and I stayed at DaNell's place this past weekend and everything was just as expected. The room had everything we needed. It was spacious, clean, and the vibe was very relaxing....especially when you're already 420 happy lol. The area was nice and quite as well and not too far from downtown.  DaNella was very quick with communication and very helpful. I would definitely recommend staying at DaNella's home... you won't be disappointed.   :)"
22379059,414153750,2019-02-18,166929828,Diego,The apartment was very clean and private. The self-check in lock made it easy for us to get in to the apartment without worrying about having a key. Very close to downtown and the 25 highway so we were able to do a lot of exploring.

Our previous visits we spent staying in downtown Denver hotels.  This trip we wanted to feel more ""at home"" while visiting.   Alan's home was perfect in all aspects of what we were looking for.  It was immaculate, beautifully decorated, very comfortable with all the comforts of home and the beautiful and private outdoor space, which we made great use of.   The bonus for us was the convenience to our son's apartment!   Alan's home is located in a very nice, quiet but convenient area.  It is a short trip to downtown Denver, bike trails, restaurants, shopping.  We walked everywhere except for a few day trips outside the city.   Alan is a gracious host who greeted us and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.   We will definitely be back to our ""home away from home"" in Denver!  "

Which I understand, but  I chose to filter entire places so that I could talk or come and go as I pleased. I felt like I needed to whisper or tiptoe around a lot. Other than that it was a great."

26453227,431720805,2019-04-01,20843399,Stephanie,Our family stayed here for two months during our transition to Colorado while we waited to close on our home. The extended stay with two young kids and two dogs was much less stressful in this house. All our needs were met and the host was fabulous with communication. The home was well laid out with all the amenities and comforts of a real home. We will miss our little home away from home!

However the flat was not as clean as expected, especially the bedroom and the bathroom. The kitchen was fine though. Despite that, I would recommend this place, the neighbourhood was nice, the public transport and some shops are in walking distance, and the center is easily accessible."

19441412,193205942,2017-09-12,29647776,Harel,I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Sheik's place. It was as described with a comfortable living room and couch and a terrific bed. I was concerned about parking space but after contacting Sheik he assured me that there was plenty which there always was during my stay. It is in a quiet area without much foot traffic so be prepared to walk a bit or take cabs if you don't have a car. But the cabs were quick and relatively inexpensive. I would recommend staying there to any of my friends visiting Denver.
8718728,204766655,2017-10-19,39281584,Josh,"Rachel was a great host for our short stay in Denver. My girlfriend and I had to do a last minute booking on our cross country road trip and this short little stay did not disappoint. Rachel's communication is second to none and was very accommodating with updates and what to expect. We checked in late around 10pm and were gone around 430am, quiet evening in the house with a comfy bed and nice accommodations in the residence. Anytime we are back in Denver I would definitely hit Rachel up again to crash here."

7817254,54933402,2015-11-25,1805161,Yu,"Will's house has neat and modern decors and the room is very cozy, even with a small fridge. Before my arrival, Will has prepared a detailed letter with all the information I needed, as well as snacks, towels, lotions. The house also benefits from cool alarm system and coffee/tea machine. And there's a big, enthusiastically welcoming dog! I had a short stay before my early morning flight, so didn't have time to explore the neighborhood, but highly recommended Will's place. "

Denver had some bad storms in the days prior and Emily was quick to communicate that repairs would be happening and she would make sure that we weren't inconvenienced. I would definitely stay here again!"
7826191,52996701,2015-11-03,46103075,Matthew,"Josh was an awesome host. We gave him fair warning that we were a group of guys in town for an NFL game and a bit of partying. He was very cool and easy going with us and only asked that we respect his place, which we did. He made the process incredibly easy and texted to let us know the place was ready and we could check in early. He even left us a great gift basket and notes about the surrounding area. His place is awesome!!! It's located in a fun area with lots around to see and do. The place is great and the rooftop patio is even better! Thanks again Josh!"
6156061,73591360,2016-05-08,2516386,James,"Tremendous spot and a fantastic host! This place is much more spacious than the pictures show, so it's perfect for a large group. The location is perfect - we were going to rent cars but decided against it since we were in a 5-10 minute Lyft / Uber ride to downtown and walking distance to a few nice neighborhood bars and restaurants. Mark was extremely communicative and flexible with a supremely easy check-in process - highly recommended and would do it again in a heartbeat! "

I had a hard time saying goodbye to this place for several reasons. It’s a cat lover’s paradise that is beautifully decorated and clean. Do Denver the right way and stay here.

We rented a car because we planned to be in Boulder and Fort Collins as well, and we never had any trouble with street parking. The drive to downtown was always under 10 mins for us. Super close to Broncos stadium which was cool! Host was very accommodating and even provided us with coupons for a trendy local bar which I thought was so nice! I would stay here again."

39405,98915754,2016-09-02,7607318,Nicola,"The cottage was perfect.  Set back off the road behind a beautiful rustic garden. Everything in the cottage has been laid out perfectly to make as much use of the compact space as possible.  The cottage was immaculate, kitchen is well equipped, (not that we did any cooking as there is an awesome coffee shop around the corner and great burger/beer options), and Gio and Jennifer were great hosts. Easy to checkin and out and extremely helpful and welcoming while we were there."

4719119,30629964,2015-04-25,10766624,Brittany,"Gary's home was the perfect launching pad for our new life in Denver. 

The downstairs is private, comfortable and quiet - a great escape. Not to mention the bed that may as well be a cloud! Upstairs, the kitchen, dining room and the backyard are great spaces to enjoy as well. 

Gary was very social and accommodating. We enjoyed quite a few intellectual discussions over a good meal or fine wine. He even trusted us enough to take his cute dog, Buster, on a few walks around the neighborhood. 

Thanks for everything Gary and we hope to see you soon!"

We did yoga, held goddess circles, shared meals, danced, and journaled our way through a deep soulful weekend; Maxwell’s space was the perfect spot for this healing adventure. The women felt super comfortable in the space (8 stayed the night) and raved about how much they truly enjoyed the spot. Thank you Maxwell for being incredible accommodating!!!!!"

We enjoyed the back bedroom: comfortable bed and quiet for me (a light sleeper). The bathroom is large, light and clean, as was the entire house.  Check in and check out was easy. We were in town working and had separate spaces thanks to Anne and Ray. We also loved cooking on the industrial stove.  What a treat! We expect to return the next time we are in town."

Besides providing a lovely and clean carriage house, fully stocked with all the necessities and many extras, also, they were immediately available to fix or help out with any thing at all.

Furthermore, they have a wealth of information about the area and goings on in Denver and particularly the Stapleton area.  I plan to use the Stapleton Carriage House again."

2267500,285057434,2018-07-02,10666919,Jana,"Cory and Grace have a beautifully unique little cottage tucked away behind their home ( so they are close and accessible if needed ) in a charming, older, historic area of Denver: The Highlands. Little did we know that we'd picked the perfect neighborhood- its only a few blocks from all types of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream shops...Walking around the neighborhood we made friends with people gardening, gathered in the front yard, talking with their neighbors. A VERy safe and friendly feeling. Inside the cottage we felt like we were in a home away from home instantly. The furnishings were lovely, the sheets on the bed some of the softest we've ever felt, lots of kitchen amenities- more than we have! We could compost our kitchen scraps, and recycle. When we met Cory and Grace, who made an effort to come see if we needed anything, we felt like we'd known them always; they are kindred spirits. When we return to Denver we will definitely try to stay here again. Two smiles UP .... "

Their guidebook is awesome and let us know that they take cleanliness very seriously, which was a great thing to read. The guidebook also helped to find some places to try nearby, a huge bonus since there was so much to choose from! 

Next time I visit Denver, Jenn and Jay's home will be one of the first places I will choose to stay! Thank you so much for having us!"

The home is well-equipped to host a large party like ours and although it is not huge, it provides plenty of different spaces to hang out as a group and individually. The big back yard allowed for some outdoor game with the childre, the front porch is great to enjoy the summer nights, the living room is inviting, and the covered patio is the perfect place to gather as a group in the mornings and evenings. The neighborhood is walkable and feels very safe and close to everything. My family really enjoyed our stay in this home and will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Denver."

5794938,351145735,2018-11-21,58900589,Amber,"Allan's place is in the perfect location if you want to explore downtown Denver. You can walk to lots of great restaurants with ease - check out Walter's for pizza, Stueben's for good vibes and delicious desserts, and Syrup for breakfast. Allan's cool enough to offer up free parking, which is a must in the area. It's definitely a tight squeeze, though, so get a small car (but keep in mind these don't always fair well on icy mountain roads). The apartment itself is quite nice - a big shower, nice kitchen, washer and dryer, etc. I had a lovely stay, Allan was an excellent host, and his apartment was a great place to rest my head at the end of the day."

In a really cool section of town with some great restaurants and super cool little shops. 10 minutes from the light rail which can take you anywhere in the city even to the airport for $9. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a quiet place in an Eclectic neighborhood with great nightlife.

Thoughtful touches like beers and a note welcoming us in the fridge, coffee and breakfast items, video games and a Netflix account, all made this a special stay and one of our favorite AirBnBs so far.

The best was very comfy - I've never slept so well on vacation, and the window above it letting in sun in the morning was wonderful. I loved the reading nook especially, waiting for my boyfriend to wake up so we could go out on the town! The location was very convenient and we never had trouble finding parking.

It did get a bit warm at night, but everything else was perfect. Would definitely stay here again."

The location is perfect for anyone looking to explore Denver, within walking distance of local pubs and restaurants and just a quick drive to downtown. Plus, parking was effortless with plenty of space behind the home.

The pictures are 100% accurate, with a completely updated interior that was spotless. 

Thank you so much for the fabulous stay, Carolyn."

We were able to relax in the morning and at night very comfortably. It's within walking distance of a great restaurant called Ester's (5 stars!) and a wonderful little park if you want to stroll. The neighborhood is nice and quiet but you're not cut off from the city, which we loved. Tonya's breakfast was AMAZING and she has some serious skills with baking (those cookies  are no joke and she even sent some extras down for my birthday ☺️) This was our first AirBnB stay and she definitely set the bar high!"
14593779,170921220,2017-07-16,118780218,Makenzie,The house was amazing and the hot tub was spectacular. Recommend this place to anyone looking for an Airbnb in the Denver area.

8390543,127049611,2017-01-15,7707279,Deyanira,"Short stay in Denver for two days. Wanted to be in a central area and not over pay for a hotel, and that's why I chose to stay here. Overall, had a good experience with good communication. Beds were very comfortable and the shower was amazing with nice warm water. We were walking distance to a lot of places and the hosts were great at providing recommendations, fresh linens and towels, and overall help. The only somewhat negatives were: 1) too noisy at night. Yes, the hosts provide you with earplugs... be aware that this is an older house and being in the lower level you will hear footsteps and even conversations from upstairs. Will also hear noises at night like plumbing or etc. It kept one of us waking up, but I wore my custom sleeping plugs all night. 2) Not so much privacy. Due to hearing conversations from upstairs and outside, I was sure anyone could hear us as well... you can see somewhat from the windows outside down into the bedroom and that made me somewhat uncomfortable. But mostly made me uncomfortable that the bathroom door has a window covered with a sheer curtain...I thought it'd be OK but I saw one of my friends naked through the sheer curtain/crack! That was not ok. 3) Backyard pictures are outdated. There is construction and we did not feel comfortable chilling outside. Overall, I would still recommend this place. But probably to a couple or single traveler wanting to be somewhere central."
1724186,33741792,2015-05-31,4542393,Muhammad,"Jessica and her husband were very friendly, accommodating and co-operative. A previous review had stated that the shower was cold and there was issue with the locks and entrance, both of which have been addressed.  The room is fairly simple as per the pictures, for the price it absolutely does the job but it's not luxurious.  It's proximity to downtown is also a big plus.  "
1454673,249766687,2018-04-02,6153869,Alina,Pamela was so helpful throughout my stay at her place. She was very communicative and offered her help numerous times for the various requests our group had. The place is very clean and cozy and comfortable. We really enjoyed the tea Pamela left out for us and appreciated all the bathroom amenities as well. We had free parking right outside of the house and enjoyed waking up to all the chickens outside. This place is wonderful for any trip to Denver!
35734859,491847605,2019-07-20,31786629,Ellen,"Welcoming family home that's super duper convenient to the airport. Spotlessly clean environment with thoughtful bottled water provided in the room. Great variety of dining options close by, too."

13815789,160074454,2017-06-12,35075850,Annette,"Beautiful quiet neighborhood, very walkable, and very hip.  The space was super clean and contemporary, very attractive and comfortable.  Once inside you are not at all bothered by the fact that it is a basement space. We hadn't realized that there isn't a sink in the kitchenette area, but the owners have managed that and once we ""got it"" we were good to go.  Four of us stayed here and we anticipate returning."
23378643,278790192,2018-06-18,106837035,Ivan,"The place was so awesome!!! Very spacious, clean, and full of amenities. It is also a maximum of 10 minutes walking from hundreds of bars and restaurants. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had. James our host was also very accommodating and answered all of our question promptly and in great deal. 10 out of 10 would recommend and come back."

She checked in with us before we left to make sure we had all the information we needed and left us with a couple of handy guides to get around. The parking space was super important to us and I liked that it was in a secure lot. Clean, spacious, and so near to restaurants and bars! "

What she writes is what you get! Honestly the place was nicer than I expected. Super super easy check-in and check-out.

The only complaint might be the sound of the garage door going up/down, but we were early risers anyway, so it didn't bother us. Cynthia is great and responds promptly to any communication. She was very friendly and welcoming! Highly recommended!"

1189999,25330950,2015-01-12,25294303,Bart,The lower apartment was as described. Parking was easy and it was very close to many places to eat. It did get cold and I was frustrating that we were not able to alter the temperature. Overall a good experience.
19113386,480851871,2019-07-03,4140134,Lindsay,"Kelly’s place was great! Perfect size for our family of 3. Good location, close to downtown and a lot of great restaurants in their neighborhood. If we hadn’t been traveling with our 2 year old I would have loved to check out some of the cool bars right across the street. 
We booked our stay very last minute and Kelly was quick to respond to all my messages which is always a huge plus with AirBnb hosts! 
Would recommend to friends."

24992798,460243688,2019-05-28,14237366,Natansh,"We had a wonderful stay! 

The coolers were already activated when we entered, which we felt was a thoughtful gesture - it was pretty hot otherwise in Denver.

The wall in the bedroom (exposed brick) was something that brought back some nostalgic memories from our own childhoods and provoked a conversation - we loved that look.

We had all the usual items available - bedding, toiletries etc, without any problem whatsover, and the instructions (wherever needed) were simple to follow.

Overall, it was a cute, unfussy place that we enjoyed staying at!"
20324521,229294747,2018-01-22,50054040,Ross,This apartment was great. Couldn't have asked for a better place to crash while being in Denver for the week.

It felt like our own little apartment in a great area of Denver and was the perfect landing pad to explore the city.  Fantastically designed space and a splendid bed that is one step below a cloud.  Good restaurants within walking distance and Randall and Dana even brought down some toys for our little one.  We will definitely stay here again next time we're in the city!  Thanks guys!"

4263714,147218438,2017-04-25,14692021,Molly,"Our stay at Melissa and johns place was great. We didn't get to met Melissa, but John checked us in and was available for questions and suggestions while we were there. There was another couple staying in the basement, we didn't really cross paths but we did share the bathroom. 

The house is in a great location, within walking distance to city park and a few restaurants and coffee shops. Quick drive to downtown and easy to get to and from the airport. We didn't use public transit at all, so not sure how that access is. 

Also, their dog teddy was so cute and very friendly. Very well behaved and only barked briefly when we first arrived. Other than that he was quiet and you could almost forget he was there. I have allergies and was not bothered by him at all."
16870147,535088484,2019-09-23,170627994,Sara,"We really loved staying in this home!  Location was just what we needed, and the home was beautiful. Would definitely stay there again!"

Elizabeth and Tom were easy to communicate with, gave us fantastic suggestions for restaurants, bars and antique shopping. The airstream had sick lovely touches like shampoo and conditioner, a Keruig for my coffee addiction and a full size fridge in case we wanted to tuck away snacks. I enjoyed waking up early and sorting out by the water to meditate. We will be returning to Denver and will absolutely check to see if this cute space is available again. "
592,75151592,2016-05-19,64209201,Gurpreet,Jill is a wonderful host.  She goes above and beyond to accommodate and to make sure that your stay is pleasant.  She is truly a lovely person to be with.

Everything was clean and readily accessible.  All necessary amenities were on hand and it was very comfortable.  The location was nice and offered easy access to the RiNo district where there was many restaurants and bars.  It was easy to get to any place we wanted in Denver from this location and the free parking on premises was perfect.  Thank you, Dan, for making your place available to us and I would highly recommend to others!"

Accommodations are spacious and very comfortable. The modern, impeccably clean bath was just outside our room and we had it all to ourselves. The neighborhood has lovely homes with character, friendly people, unique cafes and restaurants, and train to downtown Denver within easy walking distance. 
When rain/cold was forcast for the evening we were going to a concert at Red Rock, Steve went above and beyond, loaning us rain gear, warm jackets and a backpack, saving the day! "

592,5095934,2013-06-11,6806537,Samuel,"Jill's hospitality was more selfless than I could have expected. She was out of town so I did not have the chance to meet her, but the fact that she trusted me to stay and care for her home alone spoke volumes of her personality as well as kindness. I would not hesitate to stay here again. "

18811589,255502060,2018-04-20,89536284,John,"Marlene and Doug's place is truly special. The art filled space is tactfully decorated and serves not only as an amazingly comfortable lodging but also as a live-in art gallery. For my fiancé and I, our stay here will be a lasting part of the memory of relocating to the Denver area. We both worked full time remotely while staying here for 19 days and the place was perfect for our needs. The photographs don't do justice for just how great of a space it is! Oh and they also have tons of very high quality guides for the city and local food, etc. There's also some great places to eat in walking distance!

I can't speak highly enough about just how sincere and generous Marlene and Doug are. It's immediately obvious that you're staying with truly great people. At the same time, they are also incredibly amazing hosts who respect privacy and are as ""hands off"" as you need.

I'm personally not the type of person who ""gets to know"" every single host I stay with - and when I read reviews speaking too much about the host, a small part of me fears the stay will be filled with a bunch of instances of awkward and uncomfortable small talk. That isn't the case here - these are genuinely great people! You'll enjoy your interactions with them and won't feel any of that awkwardness. Stay here. You won't regret it."

This place is #house goals! Getting in the space and checking out was easy breezy. The neighborhood has a nice shopping center within walking distance, with Starbucks, Chipotle and a grocery store."

The house has wonderful yard with lounge chairs, comfy beds, plush towels, all kitchen necessities, and a great front porch to relax on. This house served my 80 year old father and my brother on a guys sporting event trip perfectly! I definitely would recommend this home for your next trip."

Also, I have NEVER been so comfortable in my life! Her beds are fabulous! If you want a great night sleep while in Denver, definitely stay at Becky's :)"
30759386,562275524,2019-11-10,223546158,Laura,The space was very clean and so nicely decorated. My firends and I had a great time. I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I stay in denver.
4288813,274249079,2018-06-08,152614175,Lindsey,"Wonderful, homey space in the heart of a historical neighborhood. This house is close to Five Points and the heart of RiNo and is an easy walk in both directions to both neighborhoods as well as downtown. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby which made for very few Uber rides during our stay. We loved it here!"
20267608,261678477,2018-05-06,20041316,Cheryl,Had a great short stay in Denver. It was nice having a parking spot as well as be within walking distance of a trendy Denver area.
21183938,233703951,2018-02-10,49711329,Ashley,"First trip to Denver!! My hubby and I loved Grant’s place. There is a bus stop right in front of the building. We rented a car for a day and were able to park in the space available with no problem. Very conveniently located and Ubers to and from downtown were no more than $10. The building is in a beautiful neighborhood and very close to Colfax, where we found a ton of great places to eat and drink. We emailed Grant about doing laundry and he responded fairly quickly. The space itself is super cozy. Not a lot of natural light, as it is a basement unit but that wasn’t a problem (only when trying to apply makeup lol). We used the full kitchen often, which is equipped with the cutest tea kettle. Overall we enjoyed our stay tremendously and can’t wait to visit Denver and stay at Grant’s place again. Thanks!!!"
3425074,313000081,2018-08-24,81001883,Ashlea,A great place for a first time visitor and first time Airbnb guest! I wish we could have stayed longer!

19786959,230037868,2018-01-26,6039443,Kristan,"Super cute and clean and remodeled apartment.  Absolutely beautiful. Was very easy to find parking out front.  Only thing to 'know' is that it is in an older home and the pipes rattle a bit at night, so if you are a light sleeper bring some ear plugs. This is no fault of owners. You wouldn't even know it was an older home except for the pipes. Really enjoyed our stay"
28658834,567142096,2019-11-21,308520447,Rachel,"The loft was very comfy and had a great location! If visiting downtown Denver, would definitely stay here again! Clean and super comfy bed, too."

13081152,289623160,2018-07-12,4967850,Jordan,"Mitchell made check in simple and easy. The room is nothing fancy but has everything I needed. During the hot July days, the ceiling fan did a good job of quickly cooling the room. The room is 2 blocks away to many good breweries. It’s about a 20 minute walk to 16th street mall and downtown Denver. Good budget option!"
31168188,522214930,2019-09-01,211720675,Parker,Andrew is a very nice guy and great to conversation with too!
24304716,452722496,2019-05-13,111268529,Stephany,"Peter is an excellent communicator. Direct, friendly, on point. He has a great system to help guests feel safe and well taken care of. Everything is clean and there is plenty of private and social space to relax. I stayed in the gold room and slept very well. I also used the ocean sound machine. My Uber took exactly 15 min from the airport and the house is in a safe area. I would recommend Peter’s place."
3968613,66219634,2016-03-20,10433537,Staci,"Erika was a fantastic host and her home is stunning - very unique and cozy. Although she had a busy schedule the 2 days I was in Denver & we didn't see much of each other, I felt very welcomed! There is information for guests located throughout the house, which I found very helpful, and my bed was insanely comfy. I was even able to park right in front of the house or on the nearby side street. I would definitely consider staying here again whenever I can make a trip back to Denver! "

3479122,40433086,2015-07-31,19806628,Jonny,The place was very clean and the looked just like it did in the pictures. The stairs getting to the place and within the loft weren't bad at all. Loved the location and it's only a few blocks from the Denver Bus Center so save yourself a bit of money and just take the Regional Transit bus from the airport to the bus center and walk the 2 blocks. Check out Snooze AM for breakfast or brunch. Get there early as it's very popular and there could be a wait. Would definitely stay here again
24746875,292692331,2018-07-18,140931856,Rachel,"This place was ANAZING! It was one of the best places I’ve stayed. Plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. Super clean and amazing host!"

Safe, and lots of food options. The space was very clean, private and comfortable. Snacks and water were a great addition as well as the coffee!  Also a fridge and microwave.The back yard was nice for relaxing. The art work by Marlene that decorated the walls is very cool! Would stay again and again."
24179534,503285306,2019-08-05,251445464,Jared,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying at Ryan’s place. We will certainly stay here again. He was incredibly close to the Rockies game, tons of restaurants, Whole Foods is right across the street which is great for quick pastries or a coffee, and right off Union Station which has access to all parts of Denver. There was also an incredible amount of towels and lots of shampoo and conditioner. The couch was super comfortable and the bed was also very comfortable. Whenever we had questions we could ask Ryan if he would respond almost immediately. He also put some pretty good recommendations for things to do or places to go in the area. Checking out the pool in the fitness center is a must. All of the other residents are also very friendly"
24452403,281425475,2018-06-24,182231064,Kalee,"The comfort and styling of this unit are far above the expectations we had of an Airbnb.  The home was immaculate and had everything we needed for our week long stay. We would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Denver, Washington Park area."
18018738,270638544,2018-05-29,110059442,Sara,"This place was great and exactly what we needed to spend a few days in Denver. The layout of the house was perfect for us.

13845981,92534120,2016-08-09,84955254,Chelsea,"Becki and John were absolutely wonderful and hospitable. My airbnb experience was both comfortable and relaxing. She was quick to respond to messages and gave me several recommendations of where to go for a good dinner. The room was as clean as a hotel room with fresh sheets, clean towels, and even a complimentary water bottle and coffee pod for the Keurig. Most importantly, I felt safe and secure in both the room and general neighborhood. "
4288813,425675515,2019-03-18,36723610,Angela,This home was comfortable and clean with excellent amenities like a fully stocked kitchen and washer/dryer. Such a great place to rest after a weekend of hiking.

20292902,312061406,2018-08-22,7486152,Heather,I had a great stay! Stephanie was very welcoming and her room was very cozy with its own bathroom. It was a short easy ride to the airport for my early flight. I very highly recommend Stephanie’s place and would stay here again!
25229354,342481564,2018-10-28,79575815,Christopher,Awesome place in a really great location. Walking distance to good restaurants and drinks. The hosts were wonderful and we showed up to a bottle of red wine. It’s basement unit so there was a little noise upstairs in the mornings but that probably only matters to night owls and late risers like myself :)
31566280,454572493,2019-05-18,154071,Kristen,"Awesome spot! Clean, great amenities and view. Had to pay for parking but the location made it worth it."

Great location, tons of space and an amazing backyard. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who wants a good time. "
19671778,267793989,2018-05-22,36805228,Carl,"Just stayed the night for an early flight due to its proximity to the airport. Quiet neighborhood, clean space and easy check-in."

13428810,330635352,2018-09-30,49557208,Adrian,"I don't think the pictures do this place justice.  Its really fun to stay in such a glamorous, stylish space.  There are at least 3 chandeliers, wood floors, high ceilings, and everything has been recently remodeled to look fantastic.  Nice architectural touches from the original Victorian house still remain- including pocket doors that open up to the front bedroom.  The main bed seems to be a king bed with a memory foam topper on it- really nice and comfortable!  The shower head is particularly excellent as well:- ) For some reason, I thought this place was a rental of the whole house, but the upstairs is a separate apartment and seems to also be an air bnb.  The front door doesn't open, and the entrance in the back is accessible either through the back gate in the alley or around the stone path to the right of the building.  This was confusing for a friend of mine that stopped by, but I got her straightened out pretty quickly.  The host was very helpful and accommodating when I wanted to extend my stay- greatly appreciated."
22209112,566210460,2019-11-18,101981119,Joshua,"This place was amazing! Very close to downtown! The host guided us with an amazing list of things to do as well  as accommodated us throughout the whole stay which made our visit more than we expected. Great place to stay overall with a group of 4-5 friends, we will definitely be looking out to stay here again! Thanks for everything James!"
26132694,452213307,2019-05-12,199092892,Brigitte,"The house was exactly as described. The coffee shop and market just a block away were incredibly convinient. If we ever had a question, Michael was quick to respond. Our stay was terrific. We were very comfortable and had plenty of room!"
2257217,25612204,2015-01-20,23716581,Dee,"Walked into beautiful aromas as Beth was cooking up dinner for her and her guests. Overall great spot, bed was very comfy! Thanks for everything! "
18361467,264790152,2018-05-14,183141430,Diane,"We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! For anyone who's not been to this part of Denver, it's going through some gentrification so do not be turned off by the location. To the contrary, you are within walking distance of the downtown area, and you'll be in the middle of some remodeled apartment houses. A lot of breweries, coffee shops, pastry shops, etc are right within the block. The Airbnb is clean, new, quiet, has a rooftop for grilling. It's great. Would stay again!!"
19391528,510878294,2019-08-16,5600000,Caroline,"A comfortable place to stay with ease! Sarah’s house is beautiful and feel like a home. Great location and communication, I would stay here again."

It's close to the University of Denver where I visited my daughter. It's within a walking distance to two good restaurants and a coffee shop. Susan and Jon have been super friendly and helpful! I enjoyed staying with them!
2467260,267422609,2018-05-21,160944242,Sara,This place is a great choice! The neighborhood and unit are very cute. Ryan is an awesome host with a lot of (great) recommendations. I would definitely stay again!

21796586,319202008,2018-09-05,82278,Michelle,"Oh my! What can I say about this place. The only negative is the steep stairs to get down to the space. But don’t let that dissuade you! The space is beautiful. Up to date furnishings. We spent 7 nights in Colorado at 3 different AirBnBs and this one was the best, by far. Comfy bed and pillows were especially appreciated!

Nice touches throughout. From charge cables on one side of the bed and next to the couch to labels on everything so you don’t waste time opening each drawer. 

I said to my husband that they themselves must’ve stayed at many AirBnBs and took what they didn’t like about them and made sure their space was up to par!"

The home is as pictured but be weary taller folks as the fixtures were a bit low (I’m 6’2, my guest 5’8) we both hit our head a couple times. All our activities were near downtown Denver (20min Lyft). Overall I had a great stay. Jordan’s hospitality and quick responses made it easy to check in/out and ensured we had the necessities for our trip."
26562549,405806187,2019-01-27,9723980,Raghav,The place was as marketed. Great location. Very Clean. Very comfortable to live in. I stayed with my family there and had a very comfortable stay. It felt like we were home. Jay was super responsive. Everything was great! Thanks for the wonderful stay!

Their place is within walking distance to many restaurants, bars and breweries. Even though the unit is published as being a ""private room"", it has its own entrance and you're locked away from the main part of the house. Its sort of like a mini-studio. Overall they made us feel very welcome and we had a wonderful stay!"

2257217,141345180,2017-04-02,11269652,Karissa,This was my second time staying with Beth. Her place is the perfect spot for travelers who need a place to crash for a night. It also works great for those wanting to explore the city. Beth is extremely friendly and I had a great time staying once again.

Check in was super easy and we felt comfortable from the moment we walked in. If you are looking for a 1 BD spot in Denver, you can't go wrong with this place."

23180611,508334197,2019-08-12,4886771,Elena,I had a really terrific stay at Annabelle and Christian's and would definitely recommend it to others visiting Denver. The room was very comfortable and clean and they responded quickly to any questions. The location was great. It was really nice to be so close to City Park and easily accessible to other parts of the city - I enjoyed taking the b-cycle bike share from two blocks from their home!
18355719,310677150,2018-08-19,1837808,Brian,"Great place to stay, close to a sweet breakfast spot. Sarah isn't always around, which is actually a bonus because this can end up being like a ""whole house"" rental instead of a private room. Either way, she's a lovely person and it's nice having her around. Her place is excellent and the neighborhood has a great vibe."
9173434,297304637,2018-07-27,201858882,Gene,I’m not really  a wordy person. Preston is a great person to deal with. His house is close to downtown. It’s a great place and great experience.
21292890,500189568,2019-08-01,199698050,Alex,Awesome spot only minutes from the city! Very clean and comfortable quarters. Andrea was always quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed. Would absolutely stay here again.

16438823,147022668,2017-04-24,46366953,Sarah,"This house is amazing. Lots of room, space, and natural lighting. With a group of 17 women, we never ran out of toilet paper or towels, a very impressive feat. The area around has all the food you can crave and all the coffee to try. Chada Thai, Weathervane, and Voodoo Donuts are fantastic places for food. These were the places we went to multiple times. The neighborhood is easy to navigate and great for morning runs. The street parking does get full, but access to 2 garage spots and a parking pad made life easy. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
26639298,531051476,2019-09-16,14658387,Beatrice,"Cute and cozy room in a great Denver neighborhood. Walking distance to some great restaurants and coffee and parks.

You can get downtown quickly by walking or a quick Uber ride. The apartment is located in the bottom floor of the hosts townhome, but you have a private entrance with a door code and it feels like the place is your own. Boon and Salimah were great hosts! They provided water bottles and coffee grounds and the apartment was clean and stocked when we arrived. No complaints at all!"
13414484,420751295,2019-03-07,45909024,Rick,"My home away from home! Cal is a great host. I love looking at all the art pieces and every time I visit, I see a piece I didnt see before. Lots of amenities and very well kept. I've stayed with Cal so many times, we have become good friends and I always look forward to coming back."

12890649,186506036,2017-08-24,131090808,Dennis,"This is a wonderful historic home in an excellent location. It is an older home with no bedrooms on the main floor. The master suite is located on the third floor which requires a lot of stair climbing but well worth it. Take a walk out the front door to the middle of Sherman street and you can see the gold Capitol dome which is within walking distance as well as a host of museums. $5-6 Uber rides gets you to all of the sporting facilities, bars and restaurants downtown. Out the back gate is Armidos, a great little karaoke bar with the best pork green chile in Denver."
2360382,48871079,2015-09-29,31682579,Bryan,"The house is cute, cozy and was just what the two of us were looking for while staying in Denver. The location by the park is great and a short walk to the rail stop. Mary was accommodating and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

He was extremely accommodating and helpful with getting us checked in very late and even woke up to take us to the room and show us around. He was very kind and his place was a great oasis for us after hiking all day. Would definitely stay again!"

4909321,183615631,2017-08-17,64198041,Halle,"Rebecca and her family are indeed vibrant and extremely welcoming. She allowed me flexibility when checking in and even offered to drive me to the light rail in the morning. Would definitely recommend!

Lyft from 16th street mall in downtown Denver to Rebecca's place was about $9, approximately 15 mins. Took the light rail to the airport from the 40th and Colorado stop, .8 miles"
1733052,42885974,2015-08-16,21183068,Joni,We had a wonderful stay with Jason and Vibeke.  The apartment was very clean and attractive and within walking distance to the Botanical garden where I was attending a conference.  Our hosts were friendly   and thoughtful in the services provided for our comfort and willing to spend some time sharing information on places to go and things to do for our travels around Colorado.  The neighborhood has a lot of restaurants and there is easy access to public transportation.  I highly recommend this apartment.
24992798,358248252,2018-12-13,12035543,Lilly,Stayed at Airbnb worldwide. Entrance lock convoluted.  Couldn't get it locked when we went to performance downtown. At 11 pm during the performance we were told that the contract for the night was canceled
11338921,494673083,2019-07-24,2370506,Paul,"Terrific place, location, three levels of fun!  You can't hear the TV from the bedroom despite the stylish open space if that is a concern for couples, family, etc.  The courtyard is wonderful, and even has a resident cat!   Very easy to find and gain entry.  I walked to most of my meetings downtown.  Grocery stores and liquor stores nearby, too."

9165337,57226736,2015-12-23,1929217,Abigail,"Scott was very responsive to anything we needed and made sure we had great recommendations for the The Baker neighborhood when we arrived. The house is exactly as pictured - so cozy! The kitchen is completely set up with anything you might need (including a slow cooker!). Everything works beautifully, all appliances, the TV and Wifi. They even have a grill set up in the side-yard for sunny days (of which there are many in CO). Scott also allowed us to use the basement to store our bikes and skis which was great. 

The Baker neighborhood is great; there are tons of art galleries and breweries near by. (There's also a great climbing gym within walking distance.) It's very easy to navigate to the rest of Denver as well as head into the mountains from this awesome spot!  "

The home is in a wonderfully walkable neighborhood that's a good launching point for adventures by car and public transportation, in the city and out. The guest room and living space have a little bit of an under-construction feel but provide ample comfort and privacy. The hosts offered suggestions on what I might enjoy during my visit and cared enough to follow up on how my days went. We were all busy on separate adventures, but they checked in from afar to ensure my needs were covered. It was my pleasure to be welcomed into their home, and it would be my pleasure to get to know them better. Here's to the next time!"

We will definitely be booking with them for our next stay!

It turned out to be even better than we expected. Check in/out was easy. The room was perfect for the two of us. It was stylish and spotlessly clean. The amenities were great. It was nice to have a minifridge, microwave, and dishes to use. Chris was very friendly (and so was his daughter) and you may even get a visit from a sweet kitty like we did! 10 out of 10 would stay here again if I'm ever in Denver!"

Right in the middle of a great nightlife scene - I could easily walk to restaurants and bars (not to mention Coors Field!).

She makes available items you may have forgotten to pack in a way that makes the experience feel above and beyond.  The apartment is spotless as well as tastefully decorated.  The location is close to downtown with a small neighborhood retail area just a pleasant walk away. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
18699249,567462491,2019-11-22,1564236,Paula,"This is a beautiful place to stay. Extra amenities include a friendly cat who makes private calls to your room for snuggle time. The bed in the Harvard Room was extremely comfortable, I'd even say exceptional in all my Airbnb stays. Shared bathroom situation, but I had it to myself during my stay. As with all Airbnb's, I recommend an eye pillow as there are no window coverings (in the Harvard Room, at least) due to the modern-architecture window design. You will get all the privacy you need in your room, but the walls are thin and sound travels easily in this open-concept home, especially if anyone is walking in the hallway during the night or in the early mornings, which woke me up, so I would also recommend ear plugs or playing a white noise app overnight. All that being said, the location was perfect for me and Nanci is a warm, welcoming, communicative hostess. I would highly recommend with these few suggestions."
34515570,456043762,2019-05-20,62031191,Chaselyn,Morgan’s place was great! It was in a great location that was near some good restaurants. The apartment is super cute and very clean! Morgan was also a wonderful host and was quick to reply to all questions. We had a great time in Denver and a lot of that was due to having such a great place to come back to in the evenings!
21752804,321171475,2018-09-09,178446152,Rishi,"Amazing home, had a group of 12 out in Denver for a golf trip and it was the perfect central location. Would recommend anyone to reserve this place if you are staying in Denver."
1724186,223769450,2018-01-01,13106709,Alejandro,"Great host! My brother and I were in and out pretty frequently so the key pad entry was convenient. Really clean and tidy, beds were comfortable, and Jessica was extremely respectful of our privacy. Overall a great stay, and is exactly what was described."
26688184,305103788,2018-08-10,203795335,Karla,"I LOVE THIS HOME!  I was in Denver on business with co-workers and we opted for an Air BnB instead of each getting a hotel room. This house was perfect. The photos and description are spot on.  Modern and comfortable, but with loads of charm. And, it is completely soundproof to any outside noise. 

Great location within walking distance to restaurants and brewpubs, and a short Uber/Lyft ride to the stadiums and downtown. 

Tom and Tara are great hosts. They have thought of every little detail and could not be more gracious!  I will recommend this property to all of my friends and co-workers...  it will not disappoint!

"
15746851,516628782,2019-08-24,25042536,Kenzie,This is a beautiful home in a great neighborhood. We loved our stay!
18153418,212659549,2017-11-18,17515394,Tim,"We were told we would receive check- in instructions 48 hours before our arrival and to contact if we did not receive them. We realized the day of our arrival that we hadn't received our check-in instructions. We sent a message, and attempted to call our host. We received no reply and the host was unreachable when we arrived, after a terrifying drive through a windy and rainy storm. No one was home at the time either and we had to wait through Airbnb support in order to get a refund."
9108143,107657491,2016-10-11,63360773,Praveen,The stay at ashlees place was great! She was easy to get a hold of and the house had all the necessary amenities. I would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the heart of Denver.
22379059,238358733,2018-02-25,119072720,Hannah,"My friends and I loved it here! It was such a cute house and had everything we needed - from kitchen to bathroom supplies. We had a bunch of fun and the beds were super comfortable. There are places to eat here in a walking distance, but we still drove around to go to places we wanted to go. 10/10 recommend here"
9032492,438054201,2019-04-15,6060296,Judith,"Perfect location, wonderful amenities. Highly recommended by a long-time Airbnb guest."

7091323,64854505,2016-03-08,58192537,Jessica,"Joseph was kind and welcoming. He offered advice on the area when we asked, and he was very polite. We were able to come and go as we pleased and he offered up conversation, but also gave us our space. His listing was just as described, and the location was very near everything we wanted to do. He had a very informative letter in the room that gave us a lot of information as soon as we got there. He was also super flexible with our arrival time! He had a wonderful dog that was sweet and adorable! "
7843605,441190190,2019-04-21,208759640,Derek,"Place was nice, clean. Only gripe was no make up wipes(host said they would be provided in description) and the towels were terrible. Also bottle waters would be a nice touch. Location was great close to a lot of places, it actually has a parking spot and the outside area was really nice. You can’t ask for a better host communication was great!"
21042069,334977111,2018-10-10,95615134,Linda,"This apt is perfectly situated for close access to a Rockies game, a concert at any of the local music halls, dining and hotspots in LoDo and RiNo. It’s cozy and nicely decorated, with a very comfortable bed. The kitchen has everything you need if you choose to stay in, and the city views from the balcony, living room and bedroom were great. The tips on parking on the street were correct, no problems. Safeway is a half mile walk, and 16th St Mall is close too. Will stay here next time I’m in Denver for sure!"
662431,463658691,2019-06-03,81319282,Mark,"A travel buddy and I decided mid-road trip to splurge on a quick one-night stopover in Denver. Tim's studio fit the bill perfectly with a hot shower, clean towels, comfortable bed (and lounger) -- all in the gorgeous neighborhood of Washington Park. We really enjoyed our walk to breakfast on S Gaylord St in the morning. 

Check-in/check-out were both a breeze. As noted in the description, there were some moments where the kids upstairs were not exactly *quiet* around dinnertime, but things settled down within a perfectly reasonable amount of time. 

One thing to be aware of - leaves/dirt blowing in from the front door! We kept a shoes-off-at-the-door policy and that helped keep it clean. Overall 10/10 recommend!"
21027425,318326212,2018-09-03,108480593,Tommy,"Very nice place with everything you’d need in a Airbnb. Plus coffee, towels, blankets, dishes, and kitchen utensils are a plus. 

Ashley’s focused on keeping the planet green and her place reflects that. Very short drive or Uber to downtown Denver and other sweet places. There’s a nice brewery and dispensary down the street if that’s your thing. 

The area unfortunately isn’t walkable to any bar areas and can seem menacing during the day, but not a dealbreaker. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone willing to do a short commute to areas. 

Ashley’s very communicative and checks on you to make sure you have everything you need."

We were welcomed with homemade cookies and great conversation and recommendations (: We would recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in Denver. About a half mile away from a light rail station that goes pretty much anywhere and great food and recreational locations nearby! It being 420 friendly was definitely an added bonus. Very pleasant 3 night say at the retro pad (: thank you tonya!

Again, the location was great! The size was perfect for three travelers! It's nice coming back to a cozy home instead of a standard hotel. Shower had serious pressure which felt great after a day of adventuring. Easy pull out couch, perfect little kitchen and ample room to place your things!"
35879415,485860381,2019-07-11,5280791,Erica,"My family and I stayed at Phuocs place for just one night. We actually arrived really late at night from the airport, which by the way is only about 15 minutes away. The room was just like the pictures posted! The beds were incredibly comfortable. The room and bathroom were nice and clean. Phuoc provided us with plenty of towels and even had shampoo and conditioner. Overall great place to stay! Totally recommend."

We had plenty of privacy and felt absolutely welcome. Thank you, Clarissa and Rich!"

Loren and his wife, Sophia, were extremely nice and accommodating for the entirety of our stay. They had tons of great suggestions for things to do around the city and the space was very clean and comfortable. The house is also in an excellent location with plenty of great places to visit within walking distance.

Overall a fantastic trip, and we will definitely be staying here again the next time we are in Denver."
25056885,463107748,2019-06-02,99255705,Genesis,The space is great.  Has just what you need and a few touches more.  You can walk 10-15 min to fun bars and food.  Downtown is only a several dollar ride share.  Christina is amazing with communication.  She’s so prompt with her messages.  I definitely recommend her place for a group 7-10.

The communication with the host was great. Check in was really easy. This is a basic accommodation that is accurately depicted in the pictures and is a good value for the money. We have to share that the tires on our rental car were stolen and replaced with retreads sometime during the second night it was parked on the street. Be sure to keep the doors locked whether you're there or not and be aware of who and what is around you, just like in any other urban area. "

17185409,494663887,2019-07-24,70255457,Kristin,Good value for near downtown Denver!  Safe neighborhood and easy check-in.  Be aware that there is only a small floor AC unit so it was a little warmer in the unit than I had hoped (it was 95+ degrees during the day!)

192430,77013112,2016-05-30,73355396,Lindsey,"I very much enjoyed staying with Kate and Hammie. The room I occupied was adoreable and cozy, and felt like a little home away from home. Her shower also has great water pressure, which is so important when you're on vacation!

East Colfax has plenty to see and do, especially if you like to walk. I spent time at a variety of coffee shops, and restaurants/bars; but, I most enjoyed visiting a shop called Spirit Ways, and reading one afternoon away at Tattered Cover bookstore. 

Kate is also very near City Park, which has seemingly endless walking paths, a lake to sit by, a science museum, and a zoo. The botanical gardens are a short drive from her place and are definitely worth a visit. 

Thank you to Kate for the advice she gave about where to go and what to see and do. Made for a wonderful and reflective solo-trip!"
1004131,518457279,2019-08-26,3588287,Renee,"This apartment was very comfortable and well-appointed; the space is just right for a couple. It was clean and very quiet.

32465459,477165398,2019-06-27,268648586,Dale,"The location in the historic Five Points neighborhood in a modern in- full construction row house,  and location on the RTD L Line light rail are great.  The home was very clean with a well appointed kitchen.  However,  lots of noise from the street (even with windows closed and TV on). Also if one is visiting friends or family and might be inclined to use the kitchen or the rooftop grill to prepare a meal for those folks,  think again.  One of the long list of forbidden activities in the house rules is anyone other than the guest in the townhome."

26162550,365850110,2019-01-01,215065907,Jessica,Picturesque and vintage feel. We loved the retro touches and seeing Thaddeus’ artwork. It snowed and in the morning there was a glorious view of quaint snow covered garden from the upstairs window. We did not see the owner during our stay. He was thoughtful in placing a moveable radiator in the room that keep us warm. For our first Airbnb the experience was great.
24262468,329809121,2018-09-29,6229827,Katherine,"Sweet, comfortable, welcoming space with artistic touches. Imacculately clean. Fresh decor, thoughtfully designed.

The Highlands are a fabulous location and the neighborhood is walkable and parking was no problem.  The home was clean and the linens were top of the line!  There’s a great outdoor/patio space that we enjoyed as well!  We will be looking to book this spot when we visit Denver next.
25369287,279421704,2018-06-20,136511561,Jason,"My wife and I visited Denver for the first time this week. This was a great place to stay. Walking distance from a bunch of great restaurants and shops.

I really like the room with double and single beds, very comfortable for 2 people in his/her own bed. I only wish to have a small fridge or somewhere to keep the food/drink cold."
13656664,133958520,2017-02-25,113668393,Fran,"This place was adorable! They supplied everything I needed from shampoo, toothpaste, cream cheese, bagels, water, Starbucks coffee, extra blankets, laundry detergent for the available washer and drier, and even access to the thermostat to control the temperature in this basement! 
Completely private despite the lack of a door at the top of the stairs. But there was a separate door for the bedroom
Thanks again!"

I will definitely be back!"

6348993,292339041,2018-07-17,201093417,Edwin,"You would be hard pressed to find a house that is cleaner, more accommodating, or offers more value than this residence. The hosts, Matt and Vicki, were unbelievably helpful and kind and are willing to do everything within their means to make your stay smoother. The location is prime (a few steps from the bus stop), the room was very clean, and the price was more than reasonable. If you're going to Denver, you'll be glad you stayed here!"
28742074,368389610,2019-01-06,179674035,Emily,"Great place, safe, quiet neighborhood with easy access. Remember there is a train station close that keeps you up at night. It is VERY loud!"

25586560,566535982,2019-11-19,77363385,Patricia,A great place to stay for the location and price. The home was incredibly clean and tidy plus a few small touches like fresh flowers and a book of recommendations on what to see/eat was so thoughtful! Washer and dryer was a HUGE perk as we had been driving across country and really appreciated being able to do a load of laundry. Would absolutely stay here again!
23616466,291353183,2018-07-15,100096775,Pat,"Very central location with plenty to do within an $8 uber, plenty of room for 9-10 people. Everything was exactly as posted. Hope to stay here again next summer!"
4339474,38523049,2015-07-16,1523556,Erin,"We had a great experience at Holly's place! The location was perfect as it was centrally located neighborhood and close to parks. The parking spot was so convenient, too. The apartment was cozy and comfortable with all the amenities you might need. Holly was so communicative throughout the entire process and answered questions right away. Overall, this was a most pleasant experience!"
13751968,109956673,2016-10-23,18054494,Joy,"The listing accurately did show the common area.  However, there are stairs to get into the bathroom, and the area where the toilet is incredibly cramped. Parking after 9 p.m. is almost impossible semicolon we had to park a half mile away from the apartment building.  The walls between the units are incredibly thin, you can pretty much hear everything in the bedroom."
13171401,85915261,2016-07-14,80366539,Quin,"This was my first time traveling using Airbnb. Jon and Shelby were awesome! They were flexible with the check in times, constantly in communication leading up to our arrival, and welcoming once we finally got there. 

The house is definitely spacious. We were given the entire downstairs area which included a bedroom, a den/entertainment room and full bathroom. They'd offered their washer and dryer for laundry, pots and pans, even set aside space in their fridge, their pantry, and their cabinets specifically for guests to use. The only downside, if I can really call it that, is that the ceilings downstairs are low. I'm a taller guy and there were a few times that I bumped my head going into and leaving the bed and bathrooms so tall people beware.

On a lighter note, the neighborhood is charming. The locals were surprisingly friendly. A friend and I walked a number of blocks just to sight see/grab some food and just about everyone who happened to be out working in their yards or walking around stopped to say hello. I don't think I'd hesitate to go back given the opportunity."
16346391,359935357,2018-12-18,38128617,Sarah,"Allison's place is at a perfect location, close to main highways, very easy to get around with public transportation, walking distance to bars and restaurants, also had plenty of parking in the front of the house. Allison's home and my room is very clean, comfortable, quirky and has everything you need. Allison was very helpful and available at all times with fast replies. She is also extremely knowledgeable with the area and Denver which helped me to get my feet on the ground as I have just relocated to Denver. Overall, I had a perfect stay and would absolutely recommend her place. Thank you Allison!"

The place itself has a really cool layout and some incredible views from the private balcony upstairs. Coors Field and downtown Denver are just a short drive away. Couldn't be happier with our trip and Salil is a terrific host, highly recommend."

Both Travis and Jordy were communicative and offered suggestions for places to check out. The location was also a bonus - it seemed to be at a perfect confluence of some cool neighborhoods so that a lot of things were just a short distance away yet you weren't only confined to one small area!"

It's clean, comfortable, and has all the amenities you need when traveling. The bed is unbelievably comfortable as well. Great place to stay!"
22402164,515330960,2019-08-22,37612013,Sara,Sarsha is a great host. She responds to questions / concerns very promptly and makes sure you feel comfortable throughout your stay. The place was very clean and conveniently located.
875596,269612264,2018-05-27,9571554,Suzannah,"This space is plenty big for those who will be traveling around the Denver area and need a cozy base. The mattress in the loft is very comfortable even as the space as a whole requires some energy and patience to maneuver around if you're not used to small living. The most relaxing area is the outside deck and garden, where there is a little more room to spread out. Matt and Polina were very responsive to any issues that came up, and were very relaxed and welcoming of us and our dog."

I felt right at home as soon as I walked in. The amenities have everything you could need for a layover or a couple of nights in Denver being Soo close to the airport DEFINITELY pays off as the airport lines can be crazy. Apart from that they were super communicative the whole way. Highly recommend it, don't think twice the balance of price,people, hospitality, location is totally worth it!!!"
16324649,263279228,2018-05-11,120245879,Logan,Andy was very helpful accommodating us for one night.

The space was creative; there were unique touches to everything, including their hand drawn Welcome packet!  I loved it. Thanks for the hospitality!"
2216969,116346055,2016-11-29,31308226,Caressa,"Jeff's place is private and quiet.  It is located on a busy road but, there is parking in the back.  His place has everything one would need with the exception of a washer and dryer.  IT certainly beats staying at a hotel and for a much better price.  We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back."
13414484,92063300,2016-08-07,76621245,Elysia,"Wonderful room, fantastic hosts, excellent location, and adorable dogs! Cal and Dave totally delivered on their listing, I would stay there again in a heartbeat. "

2146050,339668644,2018-10-21,46963067,Matthew,"This is a great place, and Ryan was a wonderful host. There was one tiny issue (a smoke detector beeping when it shouldn't have been) and Ryan came and fixed it within a couple minutes of me sending a message. The location is excellent with lots of food and drink options a few blocks away, and the privateness of the room was perfect for my busy visit to Denver. If I weren't moving to Denver, I would be staying here again! Highly recommended."

9731001,165073642,2017-06-30,35246806,Kevin,Clean room close to the airport. Small children crying during the night can make sleeping difficult if you're not a heavy sleeper.

25586560,313006841,2018-08-24,174647986,Olivia,"Had a great stay! Crystal was very accommodating and was able to let us check in early, which we very much appreciated. The apartment was clean and well stocked, and Crystal and Jeff provide a FAQ book about the Airbnb with all the details you could need, including local restaurants and bars - super helpful! Would definitely recommend!"
15764973,455485743,2019-05-19,232141433,Veronica,This house is really beautiful with stylish touches throughout. The beds are comfortable and so is the rest of the furniture. The host are very quick to respond to messages and are very kind.
59631,45797916,2015-09-06,22611207,Abby,"Julie's place was great! Spacious, sunny, and very comfortable. I stayed with my husband and two friends and it was the perfect size for us (and could have fit a few more!). We did have a rental car and found ourselves driving to most places, but we didn't have a lot of time to explore, so we probably could have found some walk-able attractions as well. Julie was very responsive and helpful throughout the whole process. Definitely would stay again!"
16087887,212024867,2017-11-15,52326328,Martin,Great place to stay for a few days. Newer remodel and quite clean.

7600940,367394582,2019-01-04,64766333,Doug,"House is amazing! We enjoyed our stay so much! When we arrived with a party of 10 people, my biggest worry was that the place would be too small for each of us to comfortably stay.Turns out I had nothing to worry about. Everyone had a bed for comfortable sleeping and more than enough space for us to move about. Super central location for city and fun spots in Highlands. Sparkling clean house had everything we could have anticipated needing with full kitchen(s) and plenty of amenities. Mike was quick to respond to planning questions and we were very pleased with our stay. Home is clean, modern, and located in a safe neighborhood with plenty of free parking both in the driveway and right out front. It is very close to a great block full of cozy cafes and a convenient drive to downtown. One of the best places I have stayed in so far and I was impressed!  We would definitely stay here again in Denver."

2119667,56171026,2015-12-09,50617651,Erin,"Nicole provided a nice, clean, and cozy atmosphere. Upon arrival on a chilly Denver afternoon the fireplace was already up and burning. Tea and coffee provided. Free street parking was ideal in this area as that is hard to come by surrounding the downtown area of Denver. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone that is looking for a small comfortable space to enjoy. "
548897,59496307,2016-01-11,49520338,Rande,"The listing was accurate and when I met Heather, she was very pleasant and helpful. "

33801108,473991518,2019-06-22,211051239,Carolyn,Stephens place was beautiful! My friend and I had dinner plans but ended up missing them because we enjoyed the space so much. Perfect hang out right in the middle of everything with a very cute and stylish interior. Only regret was that we didn’t book for the entire weekend!

5794938,114456788,2016-11-18,50742678,Holly,"I would recommend and stay at Allan's again without question. The apartment is clean and exceptionally comfortable. With plenty of natural light, the energy is cozy and welcoming. Washer/dryer, coffee/tea, and some nice treats were provided to make the stay that much sweeter. Tons of delicious restaurants right around the corner. Would have loved to use one of the bikes left in the downstairs garage for guests to tour the city. Next time! "
13107091,182506346,2017-08-14,45686431,Deborah,"Billy was a friendly and kind host who made us feel at home!   We enjoyed our coffe on the swing in his beautiful garden each morning of our four day stay in Denver.  The bed was very comfortable with soft pretty linens.  The location was ideal for us and walking distance to shops, restaurants, coffee, and a large grocery store.  My husband and I were very happy with our stay at Billy's and will definitely stay there again!"

16516286,417031894,2019-02-25,109684302,Amy,"I would definitely recommend Tyler’s place for a 420 getaway. We had a great time! Tyler freely shared his equipment with us which was super rad!
While we were canna tourists, I would stay with Tyler any time I was in the Denver area.
The home was as pictured. The neighborhood felt safe. It was quiet at night. 
Tyler lives in the basement and was home to welcome us after a snowy drive. I love people, so when he was occasionally upstairs I enjoyed talking to him. I feel he would be ok with whatever amount of contact his guests wanted. 
Location was close to everything we wanted to do."

25369287,272513222,2018-06-03,77373259,Sarah,"Great location, but older space. I think that would be charming for some, but it was a little dusty and “old-feeling” for me. Can’t beat the location though. "
3760606,352666793,2018-11-25,123176888,Angie,This is a lovely little space in the heart of the Highlands. It was also fun greeting the chickens every day! I would recommend.
34498478,532958290,2019-09-20,183932769,Shelbi,I stayed at Michelle's place for a week while traveling for work. Super cute neighborhood & a nice walkable location! Check-in was simple & the space was very clean & comfortable.
23257443,436294452,2019-04-12,51662984,Alana,Perfect for our crew of six people and a quick drive to our conference at the convention center. Thank you!
23124969,495268085,2019-07-25,187194471,Josh,"Great space for an even better price! A group of friends and I needed a last-minute place for a few days and we were luckily able to book this property. There was plenty of space for five of us and we had everything we needed. The patio out back was an unexpected surprise, as we did not see this in the pictures originally, and was great for enjoying the weather and relaxing outside. Overall, this was a great rental and I would definitely consider this again."

Hard to find a spot more conveniently located to tons of venues and restaurants and the amenities inside the condo are top notch...the bed I slept in rivaled my Sleep Number at home!

His instructions were very thorough and he was quick to help when we had any questions or issues (we had a brief WiFi outage but he helped us fix it promptly). The house is very spacious, in a great spot, and has everything you need for a getaway in Denver.

We loved our stay and when family come to town again we will hopefully be able to stay here!"

2119667,70822892,2016-04-21,28423,Barbara," This house really is as wonderful as everybody says it is.   It is warm, comfortable, beautifully decorated and exceptionally well equipped.  The bed is comfortable and that marvellous bathroom!  The wee house was such a nice retreat for me to come home to after my hectic days at the convention center.  Nicole is a conscientious, attentive and very pleasant host.
Communication with Nicole was excellent and I even got to meet her in person.  (Thanks for the coffee).  In all honesty, I have to say that the neighbourhood is a little sketchy, but it is interesting to see what people are doing who genuinely care about preserving the historic character of the buildings, and I really like the artistic vibe. The location is terrific, being close to the art district and downtown Denver.   The neighbourhood seems to be well serviced by public transportation, and Nicole provides a parking pass for parking on the street. I had a chance to do some bicycling along Cherry Creek and that was really nice, the B cycle rent a bike system is quite easy to use."

2978155,79339345,2016-06-12,31072417,Cortnee,"John's place looked amazing in the pictures and I was so glad I was able to book his place but once we arrived I was very disappointed. If I had enough money I would have booked another place after arrival. First you walk into his place it's the living room which was great and sadly the only room that I actually felt comfortable in. He left a note stating the rules and how to operate everything, sadly he noted that the oven was broken. That really put a damper on cooking. The note also mentioned a back door to use in case we locked ourselves out, so I went to see where this back door was at. The back door was located in the bathroom...with a note stating not to use because it would fall off the hinges. I then immediately noticed how disgusting the tub was, there was paint peeling off and black streaks. God forbid you were over 5ft tall you would hit your head on the ceiling when taking a shower. The toilet sat on a platform, while using the toilet you could watch spiders and flies come in from the gaps between the emergency door or hear the neighbors outside. In his pictures the door is cropped out, the toilet isn't shown on a platform and the tub isn't visible only the shower head. I then looked at both bedrooms, they seemed okay until I look closer at them. In the Master bedroom the bed sat on a platform which made it hard to get into the bed if you're short, which I am. Under the bed was tons of crap, notebooks, boxes, plastic wrap. The bed was stiff, the sheets smelled old even though they were clean and didn't fit two people comfortably. So my boyfriend had to sleep on the couch the whole stay. The guest room had two stiff fold out beds/futon. Behind the futon we found a old towel, gross. I became annoyed but waited out until the next day to contact John. The next morning after sleeping horribly and smelling the awful sheet I messaged John. While waiting for a quick rely I made a cup of tea, the cups had soap residue on it and bubbled once water was added. John felt horrible and refunded $80 to me which was okay but I expected more since I paid $400 for the stay and offered to have the cleaning service come when we were out, after discussing the offer with my boyfriend we declined. The place was just old and nothing will get the tub cleaned. John also mentioned where new clean sheet were kept so I could change the bedding, all the sheets smelled so I wasn't able to seek relief. My boyfriend was using the bathroom when a spider crawled in from the crack in the door so he found some kaboom in the closet to kill it. The only perks of the place was the comfortable couch, the..."
29830102,531549301,2019-09-17,26965081,Brittany,Kim and marke’s place exceeded every expectation. It’s exactly as pictured- but it’s difficult to describe how the big windows brought in so much light- it’s bright and cheery and exquisitely decorated. The location was really great too- lots of little boutiques and restaurants within walking distance and a short drive to many of the other attractions Denver has to offer. We used some of their restaurant recommendations and were not disappointed- would definitely recommend sassafras and blue pan.
6488535,154476527,2017-05-24,112919572,Jeffrey,"We loved staying at Brandon's and Roberts place. So beautiful, calm, cozy and perfect size for two. The art on the garage added a dope touch also. They had everything we needed and even more. Near restaurants, bars and shops, this place is definitely a must stay without paying crazy money. We look forward to booking Brandon's and Roberts place again in the future. Thank you guys! "

Ashlee & Graham kindly left a welcome pack as well as a folder with everything we could need to know for exploring the city. It is in a diverse neighbourhood with many historical and interesting houses. I loved nearby Larimer Street in particular for it's excellent cafes, restaurants and character. Everything about our stay ran easily and smoothly, I would definitely recommend staying here!"

The house is cute and Mark did a great job renovating the space.
We had a couple problems which Mark dealt with immediately.
The neighbors ( as most of these houses) are very close and share a fence on both sides with children and dog(s).  So there is a privacy factor.  We were hardly ever there and just took our dogs across the street to play."

Also we didn’t have access to a broom so we couldn’t clean any mess that spilled. The A/C wasn’t working well, the kitchen sink stop working during our stay. The space itself had plenty of room for my 12 guest!"
24452677,481967591,2019-07-05,3714646,Hope,"Great place, located close to restaurants within walking distance. The place has cool artwork and the kitchen is really set up for cooking if you want. The mattress was quite firm, so a heads up if you like a firm mattress.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
16807778,207720683,2017-10-29,128749580,Patrick And Shana,"We needed a place to stay that was near the airport after spending a few days in Aspen, and this was perfect!   The guest room and bathroom were immaculate, tastefully decorated, and smelled great.  The bed was also very comfortable.  Jonny and Micayla were very nice and a pleasure to talk to.  We especially enjoyed their very friendly cat who stopped by to visit a few times.  Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
27554417,421150927,2019-03-08,24298484,Christine,"Great location with easy access to downtown Denver.
Host was helpful and made check in/ check out easy.  Very clean and cute place."
3424315,521255726,2019-08-31,284039528,Jordan,"If you are staying here, the neighborhood is great to walk around and look at unique houses. Also, only a 10 minute walk from the grocery store. Michael is great  and very responsive. You’re sure to enjoy this B&B"
15807058,546629820,2019-10-13,68942966,Grant,"Awesome spot in a prime location. Close to many restaurants, bars and entertainment. Everything was clean. Balcony was nice to enjoy the morning! Great communication with Amanda. We’ll be coming to stay here whenever we venture back into Denver. Thank you so much, Amanda!!"
12068403,424036568,2019-03-15,176114835,Corey,"Jessica’s place was a great location. However she could’ve cleaned the place up a bit. There was noticeable debris on the carpet and comforter, dust in many places, and the carpet overall seemed as if it needs replaced. They also seem to leave everyone’s shower leftovers in the shower. There were used scrub brushes and callus files hanging in the bath tub. Good spot, good communication, needs more tlc."
18805144,464441106,2019-06-05,114888093,Jenna,Sparkling clean home! David and Brittany are very responsive hosts! Highly recommend.

Their communication was great, they checked in to make sure all was good. Recommendations for entertainment and food were helpful. I look forward to returning again in the future!"

12492320,539167466,2019-09-30,216808188,Adam,"The place is nice, cute, clean and conveniently located. However, people coming should be aware that the owner lives on the top floor. He will wait till you get there and for you to call him or text him, to personally hand you the key. The heat is set at 70 and is connected to all the apartments in the house. If you stay on the bottom floor you will hear people above you and going up and down the wooden stairs.  The bed is evidently a bit worn or at least way too soft and wasn't comfortable to my back. Also, there is some type of generator or something that sometimes goes off early in the morning (like 4- a.m.), making a knocking sound for hours at a time. These are things that new tenants might want to consider. Although the communication was initially poor, he tried to be accommodating, but knowing a couple of things prior would have let me know it wasn't a good fit."
9372481,313075904,2018-08-24,67354508,Karl,This place was perfect! The location was great and we were anywhere we needed to be in 10 mins. There’s also a lot of good restaurants and dispensaries in walking distance from the house. Good amount of space and all the amenities you could ask for and more! Would definitely book again if I were returning!
19441412,348078293,2018-11-12,191961037,Chris,"Place was awesome! Very modern and trendy, centrally located and spacious. We had a snow day and the view did not disappoint (you could even see the mountains on a clear day). Sheik was able to accommodate our early check-in, which was amazing. Chromecast was also a bonus. Highly recommend! Looking forward to staying again in the Spring for a different Denver experience."
4263714,145335647,2017-04-17,37484856,Paul,Very nice place in a neighborhood that is quiet yet close to so much. Melissa and John were very accommodating and just good people. Would definitely recommend. 
4388297,54874869,2015-11-25,7610221,Theo,"This was the ideal place for me to stay. I was in Denver for a conference, which was being held at one of the big hotels downtown, and this apartment was just a few blocks away—an easy walk. The host was responsive from start to finish, and flexible about the logistics of check-in and check-out. A number of helpful amenities were included, such as wifi and towels. I would definitely consider staying here again if business takes me back to Denver."

20170743,205814636,2017-10-22,56873877,Erin,"Staying at Brady's place was an awesome experience! He is excellent with communication - normally got responses within a couple of minutes. For check-in, he messaged me when it was available and ready. There were no issues with finding the location or parking. The location is great and the apartment itself was extremely clean and nice. I would recommend staying here."
1456614,30453817,2015-04-22,11262747,Caitlyn,"Erin's place is a home away from home. The neighborhood is beautiful and safe. The apartment was welcoming and private at the same time. It's close to University of Denver, restaurants, and a Safeway. I would recommend renting a car as it's cheaper than a cab and you can really explore the neighborhood. Erin provided me with tips for Denver and everything I needed for my stay. Thank you so much! "

We were only there for one night, however the bed was comfortable, she had clean towels for us in the guest room, and the living spaces were clean. I would definitely recommend staying if you are in the Denver area."

Most places were a short uber ride away. The house had plenty of space for our group (7 guys), great rooftop for chilling, and netflix + hulu on the tv in the main room. Would definitely recommend!

Sara provided lots of amenities such as snacks, coffee/tea, fluffy towels, etc. She gave me lots of area info and provided great conversation. The location was in a quiet area but was enough to anywhere you could to go. Her roommate and their furry friend were also very friendly. I felt right at home!"

It was fully equipped to include a nice grill and hot tub.  On the small side but fine for 2 couples and even has a pull out couch.

Whenever we had a question or needed anything he responded immediately and offered any suggestions or amenities that we requested. His place was clean, cozy, and just lovely all around.

I can't aptly express how helpful he was or how pleasant our stay except to recommend it to absolutely anyone!"

There was room in closets as well as the dressers for my clothes which was nice. Beds were pretty comfortable in both bedrooms and just a great neighborhood to be in with lots of stuff in walking distance or short car ride. 
Would love to stay here again if the timing is right!! "

The neighborhood is a tree-lined classic and generally well-kept. The house is a pleasant walk away from some great restaurants (My new Denver fav, Dae Gee - Korean BBQ), Starbucks, Trader Joes. If that's not enough, Rita has great suggestions. I did not take advantage of the super nice kitchen - but may on a future visit - I have already scheduled my next trip to Rita's. Perhaps I'll see you there!"

5630819,535962478,2019-09-25,6608218,Mel,"Gretta was an amazing host and super easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. Very helpful and thoughtful. As for space, it's amazing. Lots of room (WAY more than we needed, but we liked the location)! Very clean and stylish. Lots of thoughtful touches—I can't imagine needing something that I couldn't find in the house already. Kitchen had everything you need to cook. Bottle of wine, teas and candy waiting for us when we arrived. Robes, slippers, lotion, ... everything we needed. (Did I say that already?) Comfortable beds—not soft, which I hate, but also not hard. TV room downstairs was cool, even though we weren't here long enough to spend much time down there. The backyard was beautiful and big and our dog loved staying here with us. The only thing that wasn't ideal was that it's on a slightly busy street so there is some traffic noise especially in the mornings. But location, in general, was great."
590,8247350,2013-10-21,4933606,Evan,What can I say? She's the best! I stayed here while I searched for a more permanent residence in the mile high city. She accommodating me when I needed to extend my stay for another week.

Maura is an amazing human being and has a great energy. She made my stay so comfortable that it felt like staying at my best friend's place, and the house has so much character and style that it feels as if you are in an art exhibition. Jack is the coolest and sweetest dog as well! Her house location was perfect to enjoy Denver at it's fullest and all the different amenities the city and surrounding areas have to offer. Maura's recommendations about what to do in the city where more than helpful, and her Deliciousness jams are out of this world! 10/10 :-)"

It is located in a nice and fairly quiet neighborhood which is just a short walk to downtown; perfect for a couple spending a few days in Denver.  Roger was quick to reply to texts and answer any questions that we had.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  We especially loved the shared back patio space and were able to meet a few nice neighbors. "

I live in Denver but my place is pretty small, and so finding this gem allowed me and my friends who were visiting from California to all stay together instead of getting hotels spread around the city. This place is also pretty close to downtown Denver, so either a cheap Uber or a nice walk (we did both) gets you where you need to go. 

Overall, this place set us up for an great weekend. Highly recommended."

Adam/team was very good at communicating all the information and was very quick to respond to any questions/concerns.  The only thing is that the building is right by the highway and the area around the building is not lit as much but seemed to be safe.  It was only 4-5 min walk to the convention center, which was great."

Although we only met briefly, she was very welcoming and full of suggestions for things to do and see. She was also accommodating of unforeseen airline delays and our middle-of-the-night arrival. I would definitely recommend Sarah’s place and will stay with her again if we’re fortunate enough to find ourselves back in Denver. "

The place was better than expected, cozy, and spotless. Kodie went above and beyond for me as a guest by leaving lights and an essential oil diffuser on for my arrival, and including fresh eggs and fruit in the kitchen for breakfast. Staying in her home felt good for my soul. I can't wait to visit again!"

It's not located in the nicest part of town, but we didn't have any issues. There was a 7/11 just around the corner that was convenient. A dispensary, and a few restaurants and bars were also walking distance. Getting to downtown was about a 10 minute Lyft ride. If I was going back to Denver with a group I'd stay here again."

4471201,40583188,2015-08-01,30724876,Robert,"Annette is a lovely lady. Several of our agreements we're not realized. However, I am easy going and not going to stress it. The farmhouse was just what my family needed for a short season. 
Neighborhood is safe and nice; though don't expect any privacy from any party.  There is no real yard with this house. An aparent is in the backyard, and they maintain control of the yard. 

..  In the same spot again and I would not hesitate to stay at the farmhouse again.

Cheers!"

15509056,246054586,2018-03-24,11779766,Imran,"It's a cliche to describe a place as a ""home away from home"", but in case of this apartment, after my wife and I spent 4 nights,  we felt sort of sad about having to leave. There were so many ""homely"" touches that made this such a pleasant stay. Ranging from the throw blanket on the couch, to the well stocked bathroom toiletries, to the magazine rack. Even though we were tourists, we comfortably were able to play ""locals"" by grabbing coffee from the nearby cafe and working from the work desk in the apartment, and sometimes returning early from a night out to hang out on the cozy couch. Bonus points for Jerry recommending a top dining choice. The one improvement would be for the internet to be a bit faster."
2146050,154084796,2017-05-22,4723137,David,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay at Ryan's carriage house.  The Baker neighborhood provided plenty to explore and was central to the rest of the city as well.

We were able to park without issue steps away on Bannock st for our entire stay.  Ryan's detailed instructions made this an easy task.

We would stay again without question!"
17154609,445060638,2019-04-28,20931633,Arnita,"Our Airbnb stay was nice & quaint! Our host Ahmed gave great directions for entrance. The home is “Quiet & Clean!” The queen bed is memory foam/extremely cozy & comfortable, the room is decorated cute, with nice closets, windows & fresh bedding. Importantly, the room has a lovely modern attached-bath very sanitary with great fixtures and is well supplied (tissues, body wash, shampoo, conditioner & fresh plush towels). There’s a laundry conveniently next to our room & the entrance to the nicely furnished roof-top is steps away from our bedroom. Its was nice area to walk around but it’s sort of a far walk to the popular shopping & resturants in the downtown area (Re:16th Street mall  area etc). The only thing missing from this “Quaint Clean, Quiet Private Room” is a flat screen on the wall, that would’ve been perfect! However, there’s wifi so, make sure You bring your iPads in case you’d  like to Netflix & Chill :-)"
21028558,285411333,2018-07-03,160113857,Kelly,"The house and yard are spacious and worked beautifully for our family who was visiting Denver for a wedding. There is plenty of space to spread out.

4545539,56057692,2015-12-08,8503526,Levi,We had a great stay at Tyler's place in Denver. Location was very walkable and the room was very spacious with lots of amenities. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.
28105894,486520504,2019-07-12,192589549,Nora,"We had a wonderful trip to Denver! Lori’s place was perfect for us. Location and neighborhood were great, not a far ride to anything we planned on doing. The space was so cute, and very comfortable. Lori had a lot of small touches that made us feel extremely welcomed. Her dog Bentley was the cutest thing, and I was glad I got to meet him! Quiet space, good neighborhood, and wonderful accommodations. We would definitely be back to stay here again!"
13116342,80857640,2016-06-20,48297885,Caius,Tim rocked! His apartment was so cozy and comfortable. Very close to town. We really enjoyed our time! 
14593779,115198633,2016-11-22,104533462,Griffy," Chuck and Jordan's place is in a really unique and awesome location. We hear that there is a super cool peak of Denver only 200 or so feet away, but we were having too much fun to remember to check it out. 10/10 would recommend this place. Pictures don't do it justice, it's incredible. Bed was so soft; so expectedly soft. Chuck was a cool guy, (Hidden by Airbnb) him, he's done cool stuff! The hot tub during a light morning snow after a night under the stars and a sunny day was as perfect as we could have asked for! Check out Denver! "
11127739,171061604,2017-07-16,133043448,Liz,"Eric's home can only be summed up in one word: rad. The back porch was a lovely place to eat breakfast or grill up some dinner at night. The house had a really nice color scheme and really nice decorations. If you stay here make sure to take a good look at all the paintings. Also, take some time to draw on the chalk wall. That was really fun(: I also watched a movie on his projector and it was amazing quality. But I think the best part of this home is the location. It isn't to loud at night, but if you want to experience the night life, you just have to walk out the front door. It's. Awesome. We will definitely be coming back.  "
17607361,255821515,2018-04-21,954299,Arianna,"Liz is an amazing host. Had some guests come from out of town and needed to find them a place closeby while coordinating their visit. Liz went above and beyond to ensure a great experience for them (whilst also making my life easier!) with an easy check in, super clean and cute space, and was always available for questions. She left a sweet welcome book, made it super easy to get connected to WiFi/watch TV, plus super comfy bed and hang out space. I was also grateful that she accommodated a late night check in as company flew in on a red eye flight. The off street parking space was also a big plus, with even a cone to mark the spot and a cute welcome sign too.

Outside of being a great host, her place is perfectly located in the WashPark/Broadway area in Denver as well - easy walking distance to awesome restaurants and shops. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to visit Denver and sincerely appreciate Liz’s wonderful accommodation for my visitors."
13724407,484413244,2019-07-08,6059095,Linda,Very nice house in a great location- close to downtown yet very quiet and short walk to Sloan’s Lake. Very clean and well equipped. Marco was available without hovering. We will be back!

Jodi as a host was amazing as well! Any questions I had she would promptly respond and make sure that I was always informed of the details of my stay. Would totally stay at this location again!
13724407,255495653,2018-04-20,24337785,Alex,"Amazing value. This greatly exceeded my expectations! The location is perfect with Sloan Lake and a small store within walking distance. The host was a great communicator. When the internet went down due to a wind storm, the host was very quick to respond and help. The interior is great for a small group or someone traveling for work. I would highly recommend this gem in Denver!"
26873329,330526981,2018-09-30,103910362,Siah,"The place was great. Check in was easy, instructions were sent over Airbnb to open the lock box at the place. Arrived to a clean place with all the amenities. The place is in a great location with tons of bars within a 2 minute walk. Would highly recommend this place, it was the nicest out of anything on the street. Roof deck had great views!"

Place was super clean and felt real homey and positive.  Washer and dryer and big plus, parking right outside the door and good neighborhood big pluses as well.  Zack was super and accommodating, would highly recommend!"

19624348,437376361,2019-04-14,171361866,Terrie,"Listys Place is the most tranquil spot in Denver, yet so close to the S. Pearl St bustle with amazing restaurants and parks within walking distance. Her place is clean, modern, and has beautiful natural light coming in from windows on every side. We sat and had a glass of wine and watched the sunset with only the sounds of chirping birds!
And got up the next morning and walked two blocks to the best coffee house in Denver!"
12546318,304533423,2018-08-09,15813628,ReiNghard,"This was my second time staying at Manda's home, and it was my first choice to look for when planning my returning trip to Denver. There's a special feeling about returning to a familiar place that brings about a state of comfort, peace, and cleanliness --- returning felt like I never left. I've always felt my privacy respected even within the shared spaces, and appreciate Manda's excellent communication, always responding quickly anytime I needed to communicate with her. It's been a joy to share in conversation, and to know a kind human being like her. Next time I plan a trip to Denver I won't hesitate to request booking the 'Cozy room near Downtown Denver!!' again. Thank you, Manda, for always being a great host! - Reinghard"
1733052,174943196,2017-07-27,46420013,Amanda,We had a quick stay in Denver and Jason's place was the perfect spot. They were flexible with check in time and unable to do so with check out but allowed us to keep our bags at their place until our flight out. The basement was very nice-clean and spacious-with nice perks like coffee and snacks. Felt safe in the neighborhood and the parking spot was a nice bonus. Would definitely stay there again!
33908848,476604271,2019-06-26,108372665,Richard,"Cool, clean, convenient...Really nice place.  I'd easily stay again!"

25597429,400645810,2019-01-12,8490772,Caitlyn,"I can't say enough good things about the location of this place. The RiNo neighborhood is fantastic! So much to do within close proximity to each other -- breweries, restaurants, the Denver Central Market (to. die. for.) -- and this place is right smack in the middle of it all. It's clean and simply decorated, which I appreciate because it makes me less nervous to live there for the time being! (Nothing to really break on accident.) While my boyfriend (who was with me) complained a bit about the spotty cable TV, there's so much to do within steps of the place that it shouldn't really be an issue for you unless you plan on just sitting in Denver, watching TV. The bed was comfy, rainfall shower was great and the overall charm of the place was exactly as expected and pictured. Jelena provided me with a long list of recommendations -- coffee shops, breweries, the best burger in town, etc. etc. -- and we tried nearly all of them. She was spot on and they were so appreciated! Check in and out was simple, though my cold fingers struggled a tiny bit with the lockbox at first. (User error, though.) 

Overall: A 5 star place, 5 star host, 5 star location. Thanks so much for having us!"
19435120,277099289,2018-06-15,188265,Chris,"David and Cathy's place was awesome. The location is easy to access and close to everything. The place was nicely furnished and the kitchen was fully equipped (we cooked a meal from scratch, and we weren't wanting for anything). The space is private and cozy, and the amenities (hot tub, bikes, off-street parking, private back patio/yard area) were amazing. David and Cathy were responsive and attentive hosts, but respected our privacy.Check-in and check-out were super easy. I would highly recommend staying here, and we hope to do so again. "

Justine and Andrew's home was very clean and came with the amenities needed for a short get away to Denver.  The hosts were traveling when we checked in but Justine was in constant communication with us making sure we were able to check in okay and any questions we had were answered! Excellent communication! We loved meeting their furrbabies Charlotte and Ghost! 
Thank you for hosting us in Denver!"

The neighborhood was wonderful - we walked to city park (super-friendly next door neighbors recommended the Jazz festival there) and we were close to everything we wanted to do. Would stay here again, without hesitation."
20170743,218273251,2017-12-11,78368602,Konstantin,"Thanks to Brady for being an amazing host and welcoming my wife and I into his home. The location is great, a few minutes from Downtown, Coors Field, Mile High Stadium, etc. Plenty of dining and shopping within 5-10 minute drive. Place was great, and the host had great communication and was so nice all around, kind of like all of the people we encountered in (Website hidden by Airbnb) nice! Anyway, had a blast and would stay here again next time!"

The bedroom and full bath were clean and comfortable. Kimberly was very helpful when we asked her for food and brewery options in the city. We enjoyed the view of the mountains from the living room. Would stay here again the next time I’m in Denver!"

28393012,453055261,2019-05-14,168032102,Larry,"First and foremost, I would stay here again. It's a beautiful and stylish space that is equipped better than any AirBnB I've stayed in before. There are many thoughtful touches showing that the hosts actually care about your stay. The neighbourhood is great and even though we had a car, frequently went wandering by foot. Communication with the hosts was quick, easy and helpful. It's in a modern building that includes a patio with a BBQ, free coffee in the lobby, arcade room, dog park and more."
14593779,130961657,2017-02-09,114358189,Elizabeth,"Chuck & Jordan's rental was perfect!  The bed was SO comfortable and we had everything we possibly could need while away from home!  Super spacious and the views are amazing!  Both of them are very friendly and could give you tips on where to eat, visit, or shop!  The rental itself is right off the highway leading to anywhere you could possibly want to adventure off to and also very close to restaurants and shops!  We only had two nights in Colorado and we decided to stay in and utilize their home theater and comfortable living room to relax and order food instead of going out.  We would absolutely stay here again and recommend to anyone!  "

26281796,453364821,2019-05-15,40661084,Jazz,We had a great stay! We got there in the evening and left early morning so it was about a 12 hour stay. Instructions were easy and clear and the hosts were communicative before and after arrival. We didn’t meet anyone while there. Self check in was simple. The room and restroom were very clean!! Driving to the airport in the morning was a breeze due to the great location!
18227184,150702614,2017-05-08,111420121,Danica,"Patrick was away for work over the weekend during my stay, so I never got to meet him. Although I could assure you that he is very friendly and helpful when I spoke to him prior to my flight. Matt on the other hand was a very welcoming host, and we had some nice conversations while I stayed at his place. His townhouse was clean and the room that I stayed in was also well-prepared. Everything around is a 10-15 minute walk if you're in the mood for a stroll, otherwise Uber rides to much of Downtown Denver is less than $10. This place is very worth the value and I definitely look forward to returning here one day the next time I fly back to this city. :)"
20690944,227367549,2018-01-14,103367860,Justin,Highly recommend. Everything is exactly as stated. Very thorough information and immediate responses to questions.

Parking in the back made things super easy. She was also very quick with responses and full of recommendations of great places to go. This was my best stay at an Airbnb so far. 
9250245,534546413,2019-09-22,204784393,Mike,Great location and easy to find.   Really enjoyed the unique space and will definitely try to stay here again next time I am in Denver.   An easy 20 minute walk to Union Station area.

30929157,496649796,2019-07-27,56307545,Chris,"Until changes are made, this is an average-at-best AirBnb. Chelsea and her partner are lovely and efficient to communicate with, but I found flaws with the explanation and quality of AirBnb. No A/C to remove dampness of basement apartment or enhance comfort, entrance does not feel safe (neighborhood-wise), and the interior needs a do-over and some serious freshening up.

Other than that, Denver is a great city and I suppose their price is affordable (?). All things the same, I would pay more for downtown next time."
18775585,402226782,2019-01-17,56368,Raven,"We had such a great peaceful time at this lovely place.  When we visit Denver again, we plan to stay here again!"

We fully recommend this apartment and we would like to stay there again next time in Denver."

1959918,174063032,2017-07-24,116293032,Jessica,My boyfriend stayed her for the duration of our trip in Colorado and it was perfect. We are mostly quiet people with a dog and Mike's places was the perfect fit for us. Close enough to of the things 20 somethings do on vacations but also quiet so we felt like we had our own space to decompress. Everything was extremely clean very welcoming. Basically believe all of the great reviews you read about it.

With a very comfy queen size bed, nice linens, WiFi, full kitchen, and great shower, we will be back!  The neighborhood is surprisingly quiet for being so central to restaurants and Denver! We took many pleasant walks around the neighborhood during our 1 week stay!  Randall is very friendly and responsive to anything you need!"

The neighborhood, Five Points, is pretty quiet overall but we had Uber drivers surprised to be dropping us off there, though we always felt safe. It's a bit removed from downtown Denver (LoDo, Capitol Hill, etc) but still just a quick ride away."

The stunning house, boasting a fascinating history, is full of beautiful family and travel treasures allowing for endless exploration and surprise.  Linda is probably the most remarkable host I have ever met.  Her goal is to ensure you have a pleasant, easy stay. Linda has a perfect blend of genuinely friendly engagement with a deep respect for privacy and space.  As a long time Denver resident, she is full of helpful recommendations. And being the consummate hostess, she even drove me to the train station as I departed. If you need a place in Denver,  you would be lucky to book this centrally located gem."

21355645,350897366,2018-11-20,200922666,Valerie,"Simple, comfortable room and bathroom were clean; easy to find in a nice neighborhood just minutes from 1-70, food, & shopping; and a short drive to downtown. Both Hugh and Humphrey are very nice, and for those with concerns about staying at a place with a resident dog ... no worries here. Humphrey may be huge, but he's sweet, very laid back, and quiet as a mouse! I loved him, and I'm a cat person. Yes, there is a little hair on the floor (none on the bed/bath linens) and a slight doggie scent - but those who live with indoor pets will understand that those are simply unavoidable. If I ever get back to Denver, I'll be sure to book with Hugh!"

The place is close to Larimer street which had a lot of cool bars and restaurants. Very walkable to the bars but at night we always opted for uber. The sofa bed was a little stiff but not bad at all.

3992779,111960900,2016-11-02,42599508,Beringia,"Elizabeth is such a fantastic host. Before you arrive, she'll provide you with the most useful information about what to do, where to eat, about the apartment, etc. The apartment is fantastic-- every little thing there has a purpose, to make the guest feel at home. Every amenity is there with purpose. I loved how homey it feels. YES you are below a house where you'll hear feet above you and voices, but, honestly I found this to be as if you were a local, and I LOVED that experience! Who wants to stay secluded from the cutest neighborhood where real people live and sleep? If you really want a taste of what living in Denver will be like, this is the perfect spot. It's affordable, it's comfortable (bed was comfy!! shower was a bit small but showerhead was awesome!), it's quaint and cute, it's a nice walk from downtown, the neighborhood is adorable, and Elizabeth is always so responsive. It has EVERYTHING you'd need! This was perfect for me and my boyfriend and perfect for me on a business trip as well."

We liked that restaurants, public transportation, Washington Park, grocery store and liquor shop were all within a short walking distance.We liked the eclectic collection of books and the card games. The weather was great while we were visiting and we really enjoyed using the large outdoor patio and bicycles."

There was even a steam iron, a phone charger and basic exercise equipment in the bedroom. The details were not lost. Teddy was very helpful when I arrived and throughout my time there.

It was plenty of room for 7 of us - in fact, with three floors it almost felt like too much space! We had some problems with outlets and AC, but Lori and her daughter were quick to try to help us. Definitely recommend!"
2119667,9969154,2014-01-21,6106423,Tim And Katie,"Nicole did a wonderful job with her place.  The unit was absolutely perfect for what my wife and I needed for our stay.  

The unit is within walking distance Mile High Stadium, Downtown and Government Hill.  The location in a working class neighbor hood and there are many options for food and drink within walking distance.

As Nicole told us she is still putting some finishing touches on the unit, but we found it to be more than adequate for our needs.  It is apparent that Nicole, her friends and family put a lot of their heart and soul into this place.

We would highly recommend the place to anyone looking for a place for exploring downtown Denver and not looking for the typical hotel experience."
665622,74249550,2016-05-14,65585424,Britta,"First experience with Air BnB and it made me want to book my next trip! This place was awesome and truly lived up to all our expectations. Walked to Coors Field for a Rockies game & it was very simple & a relatively short walk (1.5 mi) wish we had stayed one more night here- Thanks, Becky!! "
34361721,519978511,2019-08-29,54995702,Lindsay,Perfect for a stay close to the airport. Zaid and Nargis were very pleasant.
34348979,474932155,2019-06-23,24953891,Chris,"Mallory's place was truly awesome!  It was larger than I expected. super clean, and had a really great vibe in general. Her back yard was nice and peaceful.  I sat out back for over an hour enjoying a cold beer and the warm weather right before heading to Red Rocks.  Her place is a very quick uber ride into the city and has a lot of local bars, restaurants and stores within a couple minute drive.  Being an avid trail runner, Mallory recommended I check out Green Mt., which was only 15 minutes up the road.  Not only was it a gorgeous place with and fantastic trails for running, I even got to see a small herd of Elk on my way back down the hill!  It was an amazing Denver experience for sure.  I give Mallory's place and my Denver experience 5+ stars!!  An overall awesome experience!"

The house is exactly as it appears in the pics - a lot of old mixed with new for a very ""restoration hardware"" feel. My family enjoyed close proximity to Coors Field and the Denver Museum of Natural Science.
Thanks for an awesome stay!"
26132694,350631247,2018-11-19,170405250,Kimberly,This place was exactly as pictured - lots of wonderful details and interesting architecture. The house is beautiful and fit our 5 guests very comfortably. The basement music studio and hot tub really made the stay extra special! There’s also a loft that fits at least one person. This was probably my favorite Airbnb ever. And Michael was extremely responsive and helpful - we couldn’t have asked for a better stay and will definitely be back next time we’re in Denver!
9770909,346730672,2018-11-09,222110166,Terry,"The place is small but clean, & nicely remodeled. TV channel options limited, but includes Netflix. The walk from nearest Lt Rail station (10th & Osage) is a bit far, & the neighborhood is probably not as sketchy as it might appear. But I wouldn't do it at night. Be prepared to Uber to & from the place which works great!"

We had many pleasant evenings by the fire pit enjoying the Denver weather. The house was spacious and the interior design was lovely. They have clearly put a lot of thought and effort into this home. The neighborhood was great, and there is a Starbucks right down the road! Easy access to I-70 made it easy for us to get out and explore the city. Thanks for a great experience- we would definitely stay here again!"

This place has a lot going for it; central location, walkable restaurants/bars, very hip neighborhood. Most importantly, the bnb was super clean and well equipped. Brandon and Robert were super attentive and promptly responded to any of our requests. I'd strongly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks again, guys!"
9250245,561518609,2019-11-09,60934576,Jessica,"Rob's place was in a great location. Very close to Coor's field and some good restaurants/ breweries/ distilleries. We especially enjoyed the outdoor gated common area in the nice weather and took advantage of the nice weather by walking/ riding scooters everywhere we wanted to go. Access was easy although I dont believe there was an elevator to get to the second floor, so that could be troublesome if mobility was limited or in the case of having a lot of luggage (I could be wrong, but I didn't see one). The space itself is cool but very different. It has 3 small floors with the upstairs being the bedroom and bathroom (no doors, to any of the floors). We never felt unsafe in the area even though there is quite a bit of homelessness surrounding. Would recommend to anyone traveling by themselves or with their partner in Denver."
